          acquiring, holding, trading or voting the Preferred Stock.

          On May 22, 1997, the Offshore Fund executed the Series A Convertible

          acquiring, holding, trading or voting the Preferred Stock.

Item 4.   Purpose of Transaction. The Funds acquired the Preferred Stock for
          investment purposes. The Funds may dispose of or acquire securities of
          the Issuer, including Common Stock, depending upon the position of the
          market, the Issuer and other factors. None of the Reporting Persons
          has any present plans which relate to or would result in:


                  (a)      The acquisition by any person of additional
                           securities of the Issuer;

                  (h)      Causing  a class of  securities  of the  Issuer to be
                           delisted  from a national  securities  exchange or to

                           inter-dealer   quotation   system  of  a   registered
                           national securities association;

                  (i)      A class of equity securities of the Issuer becoming 
                           eligible for termination of registration pursuant to
                           Section 12(g)(4) of the Securities Exchange Act of 
                           1934; or

                  (j)      Any action similar to any of those enumerated above.

Item 5.           Interest in Securities of the Issuer.

                  (a)      On June 4,  1997,  the US  Fund  purchased  6,895
                           shares  of  Preferred   Stock  ("US  Fund   Preferred
                           Stock").  The US Fund Preferred Stock was convertible
                           into  799,420   shares  of  Common  Stock  ("US  Fund
                           Conversion Shares").

                           On June 4, 1997,  the Offshore Fund  purchased  1,105
                           shares of Preferred  Stock  ("Offshore Fund Preferred
                           Stock").   The  Offshore  Fund  Preferred   Stock  is
                           convertible  into  128,116  shares  of  Common  Stock
                           ("Offshore Fund Conversion Shares").

                           Because of their relationship as affiliated entities,
                           both Funds may be deemed to  beneficially  own the US
                           Fund   Conversion   Shares  and  the  Offshore   Fund
                           Conversion  Shares.  As the  general  partner of both
                           Funds, Fleming Partners may be deemed to beneficially
                           own the US Fund  Conversion  Shares and the  Offshore
                           Fund  Conversion  Shares.  As the general  partner of
                           Fleming   Partners,   Discovery   may  be  deemed  to
                           beneficially  own  the  US  Fund  and  Offshore  Fund
                           Conversion  Shares.  As  investment  adviser  to  the
                           Funds,  controlling  member of Discovery and the sole
                           limited  partner  of  Fleming  Partners,  RFI  may be
                           deemed to  beneficially  own the US Fund and Offshore
                           Fund Conversion Shares. RFH is the indirect 80% owner
                           of RFI. Thus, as the indirect  parent of RFI, RFH may
                           be  deemed  to  beneficially  own  the  US  Fund  and
                           Offshore Fund Conversion Shares.

                           Pursuant to the Offshore  Fund's Limited  Partnership
                           Agreement   (attached   hereto   as   Exhibit  3  and
                           incorporated  herein by reference),  Fleming Bermuda,
                           one of  the  Offshore  Fund's  general  partners,  is
                           responsible for the Offshore  Fund's  administrative,
                           secretarial   and  related   management   activities.
                           Fleming    Bermuda   has   no   authority   over   or
                           responsibility  for the investment  management of the
                           Offshore Fund.

                           As of June 4,  1997,  each  Reporting  Person  may be
                           deemed  to have  owned  beneficially  5.2% of  Common
                           Stock, on an aggregated  basis,  which  percentage is
                           calculated based upon (i) 15,912,999 shares of Common
                           Stock  reported  outstanding by the Issuer on May 20,
                           1997,  and (ii) the number of shares of Common  Stock
                           (927,536)  issuable  upon  conversion  of the US Fund
                           Preferred  Stock and Offshore Fund  Preferred  Stock.
                           The  percentage is calculated by dividing  927,536 by
                           16,840,535,  which  is  the  sum  of  15,912,999  and
                           927,536.

                  (b)      The   information   required  by  this  paragraph  is
                           reflected on Lines 7-10 of each  Reporting  Person's 
                           cover page, incorporated herein by reference.
                      
                  (c)      On  July  9,  1997,  thirty-three  and  one-third
                           percent (33 1/3%) of the outstanding  Preferred Stock
                           was converted into Common Stock at a conversion price
                           of $8.625 under the mandatory  conversion  provisions
                           contained  in  the   Certificate   of   Designations,
                           Preferences   and  Rights  of  Series  A  Convertible
                           Preferred  Stock of Anicom,  Inc, dated as of May 21,
                           1997 ("Certificate of Designations,"  attached hereto
                           as Exhibit 4 and  incorporated  herein by reference).
                           The  mandatory   conversion  reduced  each  Reporting
                           Person's  aggregate  beneficial  ownership  to 5.28%,
                           which   percentage  is  calculated   based  upon  (i)
                           15,912,999    shares   of   Common   Stock   reported
                           outstanding  by the Issuer on May 20, 1997;  (ii) the
                           number of shares of Common Stock  (927,536)  issuable
                           upon  conversion  of the US Fund  and  Offshore  Fund
                           Preferred  Stock;  and (iii) the  number of shares of
                           Common   Stock   issued   upon   conversion   of  the
                           other outstanding Preferred  Stock (734,300).

                           As a result of the mandatory  conversion,  the US and
                           Offshore  Funds  received  309,178  shares  of Common
                           Stock.  After the  mandatory  conversion,  the US and
                           Offshore  Funds sold 253,800  shares of Common Stock,
                           on  dates  and in  amounts  which  are set  forth  in
                           Appendix  3  hereto.  Specifically,   each  Reporting
                           Persons aggregate  beneficial ownership fell below 5%
                           on July 14,  1997.  To date,  the sale of the  Common
                           Stock  reduced  each  Reporting   Person's  aggregate
                           beneficial  ownership to 3.80%,  which  percentage is
                           calculated based upon (i) 15,912,999 shares of Common
                           Stock  reported  outstanding by the Issuer on May 20,
                           1997;  (ii) the  number of  shares  of  Common  Stock
                           (927,536) issuable upon conversion of the US Fund and
                           Offshore  Fund  Preferred  Stock  less the  number of
                           shares of Common  Stock  sold by the US and  Offshore
                           Funds (253,800); and (ii) the


<PAGE>



                           number  of  shares  of  Common   Stock   issued  upon
                           conversion of the other  outstanding  Preferred Stock
                           (734,300).   More  information  about  the  mandatory
                           conversion provisions is contained in Item 6, below.

                           Except  as set  forth  above,  none of the  Reporting
                           Persons has effected any  transactions  in the Common
                           Stock during the last 60 days.

                    (d)    No other  person  is  known to have the  right to
                           receive  or  the  power  to  direct  the  receipt  of
                           dividends from, or any proceeds from the sale of, the
                           shares of Common Stock  beneficially  owned by any of
                           the Reporting Persons.

Item 6.           Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships with
                  Respect to Securities of the Issuer.

                  The Funds acquired their respective  shares of Preferred Stock
                  pursuant to a Series A Convertible  Preferred  Stock  Purchase
                  Agreement  dated as of May 20, 1997 and  executed by the Funds
                  on May  22,  1997 by and  among  the  Issuer  and  Fleming  US
                  Discovery Fund III, L.P.,  Fleming US Discovery  Offshore Fund

                  Dean Huizenga Trust,  Summer Hill Partners,  L.P., Summer Hill
                  R.T.  Enterprises  Limited   Partnership,   Garfam  Investors,
                  L.L.C., S. James Perlow, Earl Perlow, Mark Perlow, KA Trading,
                  KA  Management,  CEW Partners,  Trust  Investments,  Inc., The
                  Lincoln Fund, L.P., The Lincoln Fund Tax Advantage,  L.P., and
                  The Gordon Fund, L.P.  (collectively,  the "Purchasers").  The
                  holders of Preferred Stock ("Preferred Stockholders") have the
                  option of  participating,  on a pro rata basis,  in any future
                  issuance by the Issuer of privately  placed  preferred  and/or
                  Common  Stock,  and the Preferred  Stockholders  currently are
                  entitled to one vote per share of Common Stock into which each
                  share  of  Preferred  Stock  is  convertible.   The  Preferred
                  Stockholders are entitled to receive  cumulative  preferential
                  dividends  at a rate of 5%  annually  for the first five years
                  and  15%  annually  thereafter.  By  virtue  of the  Series  A
                  Convertible Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement, the Purchasers
                  acquired,  in the aggregate,  27,000 shares of Preferred Stock
                  for $1,000.00 per share, which shares are convertible,  in the
                  aggregate, into 3,130,435 shares of Common Stock.

                  The Certificate of Designations, which sets forth the terms of
                  conversion for the Preferred Stock, contains mandatory
                  conversion provisions. Under these provisions, the Preferred
                  Stock automatically converts in Common Stock upon the
                  following conditions:

                   (i)     if, during the first twelve months  following the
                           issuance  date,  the  average  trading  price  of the
                           Common  Stock  is at  least  130%  of the  conversion
                           price,  then  33 1/3%  of the  outstanding  Preferred
                           Stock converts into Common Stock;

                  (ii)     if during the first twenty-four  months following the
                           issuance  date,  the  average  trading  price  of the
                           Common Stock equals or exceeds 160% or 190%,  then 66
                           2/3%  and  100%,  respectively,  of  the  outstanding
                           Preferred Stock converts in Common Stock; and

                  (iii)    if,  after  the  second   anniversary  of  the
                           issuance  date,  the  average  trading  price  of the
                           Common Stock equals or exceeds 140%, 150% or 175% for
                           year three, four or five, respectively, following the
                           issuance date, then 100% of the outstanding Preferred
                           Stock  converts  into Common  Stock.  As discussed in
                           response  to  Item  5(c),   a  mandatory   conversion
                           pursuant to (i) above  occurred on July 9, 1997.  The
                           terms of  conversion  are  more  fully  set  forth in
                           Section 4 of the Certificate of Designations.

                  A  Stockholder's  Agreement dated as of May 20, 1997 (attached
                  hereto as Exhibit 5 and incorporated herein by reference), was
                  entered into by the Issuer,  Scott C. Anixter  ("Anixter") and
                  each of the Purchasers.  The Stockholders'  Agreement provides
                  that in the event  Anixter  receives a bona fide written offer
                  to  purchase  20%  or  more  of the  shares  of  Common  Stock
                  beneficially  owned  by  him,  then  each  of  the  individual
                  Purchases shall have the right to sell a proportionate  number
                  of their  shares of Common  Stock then  convertible  from each
                  Purchaser's Preferred Stock. These "Tag-Along" rights are more
                  fully set forth in Section 1 of the Stockholders' Agreement.

                  In the Limited  Partnership  Agreements of the US Fund and the
                  Offshore  Fund,  each dated as of September  27, 1996 attached
                  hereto  as  Exhibits  2 and  6,  and  incorporated  herein  by
                  reference),  the Funds and their  respective  limited partners
                  agreed  that  (i)  all  investment   opportunities   would  be
                  apportioned  between the Funds in  proportion  to the relative
                  amounts of capital  committed  to each Fund and (ii) the Funds
                  would  sell or  otherwise  dispose  of  their  investments  at
                  substantially  the same time, on substantially the same terms,
                  in  amounts  proportionate  to  the  relative  size  of  their
                  investments.

               (d)   A Purchaser who requests such information pursuant to this
Section 8.1 (a "REQUESTING PURCHASER") hereby acknowledges that it is aware of
the restrictions imposed by federal and state securities laws on a person
possessing material nonpublic information about a company. In this regard, a
Requesting Purchaser hereby agrees that while it is in possession of material
nonpublic information with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries, such
Requesting Purchaser will not purchase or sell any securities of the Company, or
communicate such information to any third party, in violation of any such laws.
Such Requesting Purchaser also agrees that, if requested by the Company, such

Purchaser, then each such Purchaser shall have the right to purchase that number
of New Securities at the same price and on the same terms proposed to be issued
or sold by the Company so that such Purchaser would after the issuance and sale

other rights, including the Convertible Preferred Stock, convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for Common Stock have been converted, exchanged
or exercised) as was held by such Purchaser immediately prior to such issuance
and sale (the "PROPORTIONATE PERCENTAGE").

         The Company shall give each Purchaser written notice of its intention
to issue and sell New Securities, describing the type of New Securities, the
price and the general terms and conditions upon which the Company proposes to
issue the same. Each Purchaser shall have twenty-five (25) days from the giving
of such notice to agree to purchase all (or any part) of its Proportionate
Percentage of New Securities for the price and upon the terms and conditions
specified in the notice by giving written notice to the Company and stating
therein the quantity of New Securities to be purchased.

         If Purchasers fail to exercise in full such right within twenty-five
(25) days, the Company shall have one hundred twenty-five (125) days
thereafter to sell the New Securities in respect of which Purchasers' rights
were not exercised, at a price and upon general terms and conditions no more
favorable to the buyers thereof than specified in the Company's notice to
Purchasers pursuant to this Section. If the Company has not sold the New
Securities within such one hundred twenty-five (125) day period, the Company
shall not thereafter issue or sell any New Securities, except by giving
Purchasers the right to purchase their Proportionate Percentage in the manner
provided above.

         8.3   Shelf Registration.

               (a)   Within 45 days after the Closing Date, the Company shall
prepare and file with the SEC a Registration Statement for an offering to be
made on a delayed or continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act
(a "SHELF REGISTRATION") registering the resale from time to time by Purchasers
of all of the Registrable Securities (the "INITIAL SHELF REGISTRATION"). The
Registration Statement for any Shelf Registration shall be on Form S-3 or
another appropriate form permitting registration of such Registrable Securities
for resale by Purchasers in the manner or manners designated by them. The
Company shall use its best efforts to cause the Initial Shelf Registration to
become effective under the Securities Act as promptly as is practicable and to
keep the Initial Shelf Registration continuously effective under the Securities
Act until the end of the Effectiveness Period. If the Company fails to file the
Initial Shelf Registration within 45 days after the Closing Date, then, unless
such a delay is attributable to any Purchaser not timely providing information
reasonably requested by the Company, the dividend payable upon the Convertible
Preferred Stock shall increase to 15% per annum until such Initial Shelf
Registration is filed. In such instance, upon filing such Initial Shelf
Registration, the dividend shall revert to 5%. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
until the Initial Shelf Registration is declared effective by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, no shares of Convertible Preferred Stock shall be converted
pursuant to Section 4(b) of the Certificate of Designation.

               (b)   If the Initial Shelf Registration or any Subsequent Shelf
Registration (as defined below) ceases to be effective for any reason at any
time during the Effectiveness Period (other than because all Registrable
Securities shall have been sold or shall have ceased to be Registrable
Securities), the Company shall use its best efforts to obtain the prompt
withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness thereof, and in any event
shall within thirty days of such cessation of effectiveness amend the Shelf
Registration in a manner reasonably expected to obtain the withdrawal of the
order suspending the effectiveness thereof, or file an additional Shelf
Registration covering all of the Registrable Securities (a "SUBSEQUENT SHELF
REGISTRATION"). If a Subsequent Shelf Registration is filed, the Company shall
use all reasonable efforts to cause the Subsequent Shelf Registration to become
effective as promptly as is practicable after such filing and to keep such
Registration Statement continuously effective until the end of the Effectiveness
Period.

               (c)   The Company shall supplement and amend the Shelf
Registration if required by the rules, regulations or instructions applicable to
the registration form used by the Company for such Shelf Registration, if
required by the Securities Act or the SEC, or if reasonably requested by
Purchasers.

               (d)   From time to time, the Company shall prepare and file with
the SEC a post-effective amendment to the Shelf Registration or a supplement to
the related Prospectus or a supplement or amendment to any document incorporated
therein by reference or any other required document, so that such Registration
Statement will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, and so that, as thereafter delivered to
purchasers of the Registrable Securities



                                     - 22 -


<PAGE>



being sold thereunder, such Prospectus will not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading; provide Purchasers copies of any documents
filed in such numbers as Purchasers shall reasonably request; and inform
Purchasers that the Company has complied with its obligations and that the
Registration Statement and related Prospectus may be used for the purpose of
selling all or any of such Registrable Securities (or that, if the Company has
filed a post-effective amendment to the Shelf Registration which has not yet
been declared effective, the Company will notify Purchasers to that effect, will
use its best efforts to secure promptly the effectiveness of such post-effective
amendment and will immediately so notify Purchasers when the amendment has
become effective).

                  (e)   Registration Expenses. All fees and expenses incident to
the Company's performance of or compliance with a Shelf Registration pursuant to
this Agreement shall be borne by the Company whether or not any Registration
Statement becomes effective. Such fees and expenses shall include, without
limitation, (i) all registration and filing fees (including, without limitation,
fees and expenses (x) with respect to filings required to be made with the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and (y) of compliance with
federal securities or Blue Sky laws (including, without limitation, fees and
disbursements of counsel to Purchasers in connection with Blue Sky
qualifications of the Registrable Securities under the laws of such
jurisdictions as Purchaser may designate)), (ii) printing expenses, (iii)
messenger, telephone and delivery expenses, (iv) reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel for the Company and counsel for Purchasers in
connection with the Registration not to exceed $10,000, (v) fees and
disbursements of the Company's independent certified public accountants
(including the expenses of any special audit and "comfort" letters required by
or incident to such performance) and (vi) Securities Act liability insurance
obtained by the Company in its sole discretion. In addition, the Company shall
pay its internal expenses (including, without limitation, all salaries and
expenses of its officers and employees performing legal or accounting duties),
the expense of any annual audit, the fees and expenses incurred in connection
with the listing of the Registrable Securities on any securities exchange or the
Nasdaq Stock Market, as the case may be, on which similar securities issued by
the Company are then listed and the fees and expenses of any Person, including
special experts, retained by the Company. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
subsection, Purchasers shall pay all registration expenses to the extent the
Company is prohibited by applicable Blue Sky laws from paying for or on behalf
of Purchasers.

               (f)   Indemnity.

                     (i)     In the event of the registration or qualification
of any Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration, the Company
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Purchaser, each officer, director,
employee, agent and representative of each Purchaser, each underwriter, broker
or dealer, if any, of such Registrable Securities, and each other Person, if
any, who controls such Purchaser, underwriter, broker or dealer within the
meaning of the Securities Act, Exchange Act or any other applicable securities
laws, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
actions in respect thereof), joint or several, to which any of them may



                                     - 23 -


<PAGE>



become subject under the Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws
or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions
in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in any Registration
Statement (including all documents incorporated therein by reference) under
which such Registrable Securities were registered or qualified under the
Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws, any preliminary
prospectus or final prospectus relating to such Registrable Securities, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission
or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or any
violation by the Company of any rule or regulation under the Securities Act or
any other applicable securities laws applicable to the Company or relating to
any action or inaction required by the Company in connection with any such
registration or qualification and will reimburse each Purchaser, each officer,
director, employee, agent and representative of each Purchaser, each such
underwriter, broker or dealer and each such controlling Person for any legal or
other expenses reasonably incurred by any of them in connection with
investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the
extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based
upon an untrue statement or omission made in such Registration Statement, such
preliminary prospectus, such final prospectus or such amendment or supplement
thereto or violation in reliance upon and in conformity with written information
furnished to the Company by any Purchaser, or any officer, director, employee,
agent or representative of any Purchaser specifically and expressly for use in
the preparation thereof; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that the Company shall not be
liable to any Person who participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale
of Registrable Securities or any other Person, if any, who controls such
underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act, in any such case to the
extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability (or action or proceeding in
respect thereof) or expense arises out of such Person's failure to send or give
a copy of the Prospectus, as the same may be then supplemented or amended, to
the Person asserting an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission
or alleged omission at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of
Registrable Securities to such Person if such statement or omission was
corrected in such Prospectus so long as such Prospectus, and any amendments or
supplements thereto, have been furnished to such underwriter in sufficient
numbers and in a timely-manner to permit distribution thereof.

                     (ii)    In the event of the registration or qualification
of any Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration, each Purchaser
severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless (in the same manner and to the
same extent as set forth in Section 8.3(f)(i) above) the Company, its officers
and directors and each other Person, if any, who controls the Company within the
meaning of the Securities Act with respect to any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement in, or omission or alleged omission from, such registration
statement, any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein, or
any amendment or supplement thereto, if such statement or omission (i) arises
from information provided by that Purchaser and (ii) was made in reliance upon
and in conformity with written information which that Purchaser furnished to the
Company through an instrument duly executed by it specifically stating that it
is for use in the preparation of such registration statement, preliminary
prospectus, final prospectus, amendment or supplement. Such



                                     - 24 -


<PAGE>



indemnity shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation
made by or on behalf of the Company or any such director, officer or controlling
Person and shall survive the transfer of such securities by that Purchaser.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Purchaser shall be liable under this Section
8.3(f)(ii) for an amount in excess of that Purchaser's purchase price as set
forth on Exhibit A.

                     (iii)   Promptly after receipt by a Person entitled to
indemnification under this Section 8.3(f) (an "Indemnified Party") of notice of
the commencement of any action or claim relating to any Registration Statement
filed pursuant to a Shelf Registration or as to which indemnity may be sought
hereunder, such Indemnified Party will, if a claim for indemnification hereunder
in respect thereof is to be made against any other party hereto (an
"INDEMNIFYING PARTY"), give written notice to such Indemnifying Party of the
commencement of such action or claim, but the omission to so notify the
Indemnifying Party will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability
that it may have to any Indemnified Party except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby. In case any such action is
brought against an Indemnified Party, and it notifies an Indemnifying Party of
the commencement thereof, the Indemnifying Party will be entitled (at its own
expense) to participate in and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any
other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense, with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party, of such action provided that
the Indemnifying Party shall not settle or compromise such action, except upon
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party and, after notice from the
Indemnifying Party to such Indemnified Party of its election so to assume the
defense thereof, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable to such Indemnified
Party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified
Party in connection with the defense thereof, other than the reasonable cost of
investigation; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the assumption of such defense shall not
give rise in the reasonable opinion of the Indemnified Party or its counsel to
any conflict. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to employ its own counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses
of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Party unless (A) the
employment of such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by the
Indemnifying Party in connection with the defense of such suit, action, claim or
proceeding, (B) the Indemnifying Party shall not have employed counsel
(reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party) to take charge of the defense
of such action, suit, claim or proceeding, or (C) such Indemnified Party shall
have reasonably concluded, based upon the advice of counsel, that there may be
defenses available to it that are different from or additional to those
available to the Indemnifying Party which, if the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party were to be represented by the same counsel, could result in a
conflict of interest for such counsel or materially prejudice the prosecution of
the defenses available to such Indemnified Party. If any of the events specified
in clauses (A), (B) or (C) of the preceding sentence shall have occurred or
shall otherwise be applicable, then the fees and expenses of one counsel or firm
of counsel selected by the Indemnified Party (and reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnifying Party) shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party. If, in any such
case, the Indemnified Party employs separate counsel, the Indemnifying Party
shall not have the right to direct the defense of such action, suit, claim or
proceeding on behalf of the Indemnified Party and the Indemnified Party shall
assume such defense and/or settle or compromise such action; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that an Indemnifying Party shall not



                                     - 25 -


<PAGE>



be liable for the settlement or compromise of any action, suit, claim or
proceeding effected without its prior written consent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld.

               (g)   Mergers, Etc. The Company shall not, directly or
indirectly, enter into any merger, consolidation, or reorganization in which the
Company shall not be the surviving corporation unless the proposed surviving
corporation shall, prior to such merger, consolidation, or reorganization, agree
in writing to assume the obligations of the Company under this Section, and for
that purpose references hereunder to "Registrable Securities" shall be deemed to
be references to the securities that Purchasers would be entitled to receive in
exchange for Registrable Securities under any such merger, consolidation, or
reorganization.

         8.4   Delay and Holdback of Registration.

               (a)   With regard to and notwithstanding Section 8.3, the Company
may delay filing a registration statement for a period of time not to exceed
thirty (30) trading days, and may withhold efforts to cause the registration
statement to become effective, if the Company determines in good faith that such
registration might (i) interfere with or affect the negotiation or completion of
any transaction that is being contemplated by the Company (whether or not a
final decision has been made to undertake such transaction) at the time the
right to delay is exercised, or (ii) involve initial or continuing disclosure
obligations that might not be in the best interest of the Company's
stockholders. The Company may exercise its rights under this Section 8.4(a) no
more than two times per calendar year. During any period (a "TOLLING PERIOD")
for which the Company has exercised its rights under this Section 8.4(a), any
mandatory conversion under Section 4(b) of the Certificate of Designation will
be delayed until the first business day after the Tolling Period.

               (b)   If, after a registration statement becomes effective, the
Company advises Purchasers that the Company considers it appropriate for the
registration statement to be amended, the Company shall use its best reasonable
efforts to amend such registration statement as soon as practicable and the
holders of such shares shall suspend any further sales of their registered
shares until the Company advises them that the registration statement has been
so amended.

         8.5   Negative Covenants. So long as twenty percent (20%) of the shares
of Convertible Preferred Stock issued hereunder are then outstanding, without
the prior written consent of holders owning a majority of the then outstanding
shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, the Company shall not:

               (a)   Issue any shares or class or series of Preferred Stock or
Common Stock which is senior to, or pari passu with, the Convertible Preferred
Stock (other than the Convertible Preferred Stock issued pursuant hereto);

               (b)   Declare or pay any dividend on its Common Stock if any
dividends are unpaid on the Convertible Preferred Stock; or



                                     - 26 -


<PAGE>



               (c)   Redeem for cash any other securities issued by the Company.

               (d)   Directly or indirectly, enter into any merger,
consolidation or other reorganization in which the Company shall not be the
surviving corporation, unless (i) such merger, consolidation or reorganization
is completed in compliance with Section 8.3(g) of this Agreement and Section
4(d)(iv) of the Certificate of Designations, and (ii) the surviving corporation
shall, prior to such merger, consolidation or reorganization, agree in writing
to assume the obligations of the Company under this Agreement and the
Certificate of Designations.



                                    SECTION 9

                                  Miscellaneous

         9.1   Amendment; Waiver. Neither this Agreement nor any provision
hereof may be amended, modified, supplemented or waived, except by a written
instrument executed by (i) the Company and (ii) Purchasers holding a majority in
interest of the Convertible Preferred Stock issued and sold pursuant to this
Agreement and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof.

         9.2   Notices. Any notices or other communications required or
permitted hereunder shall be sufficiently given if in writing and delivered in
Person, transmitted by facsimile transmission (fax) or sent by registered or
certified mail (return receipt requested) or recognized overnight delivery
service, postage pre-paid, addressed as follows, or to such other address has
such party may notify to the other parties in writing:

                     Facsimile No.: (312) 902-1061

               (b)   if to the Purchaser:

<PAGE>



                     To the address listed next to each such purchaser on
Exhibit A hereto.

A notice or communication will be effective (i) if delivered in Person or by
overnight courier, on the business day it is delivered, (ii) if transmitted by
telecopier, on the business day of actual confirmed receipt by the addressee
thereof, and (iii) if sent by registered or certified mail, three (3) business
days after dispatch.

         9.3   Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. All
representations and warranties made in, pursuant to or in connection with this
Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement, any
investigation at any time made by or on behalf of any Purchaser, and the sale
and purchase of the Convertible Preferred Stock and payment therefor for a
period of two (2) years; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the representations and
warranties made in Sections 4.17 (Environmental), 4.20 (Benefits) and 4.21
(Taxes) shall survive the applicable statutory period of limitations with
respect to any liabilities covered thereby.

         9.4   Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited
by or invalid under applicable law, such provision will be ineffective only to
the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder
of this Agreement.

         9.5   Successors and Assigns. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
provisions hereof shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the
successors and assigns of the parties hereto, including, without limitation,
each transferee of all or any portion of the Convertible Preferred Stock. No
party hereto may assign its rights or delegate its obligations under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto;
provided, however, a Purchaser may assign its rights and delegate its
obligations under this Agreement upon the Company's prior written consent which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld. The Parties agree that, among other
reasons, it will be reasonable for the Company to withhold such consent if the
proposed assignee is a competitor to the Company or an Affiliate thereof.

         9.6   Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other documents
delivered pursuant hereto constitute the full and entire understanding and
agreement between the parties with regard to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and supersede and cancel all prior representations, alleged warranties,
statements, negotiations, undertakings, letters, acceptances, understandings,
contracts and communications, whether verbal or written, among the parties
hereto and thereto or their respective agents with respect to or in connection
with the subject matter hereof.

         9.7   Choice of Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to
principles of conflict of laws.

         9.8   Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate counterparts, with the
same effect as if all parties had signed



                                     - 28 -


<PAGE>



the same document. All such counterparts shall be deemed an original, shall be
construed together and shall constitute one and the same instrument.

         9.9   Costs and Expenses. The Company shall pay all reasonable fees and
disbursements of Purchasers' legal counsel as well as other reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Purchasers in connection with the negotiation
and execution of the Transaction Documents (including amounts paid or owed to
third parties), not to exceed the amounts set forth in SCHEDULE 9.9.

         9.10   Indemnification.

               (a)   The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each
Purchaser and its Affiliates, and its respective partners, co-investors,
officers, directors, employees, agents, consultants, attorneys and advisers
(each, a "PURCHASER INDEMNIFIED PARTY"), from and against any and all actual
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including, without
limitation, environmental liabilities, costs and expenses and all reasonable
fees, expenses and disbursements of counsel), joint or several (hereinafter
collectively referred to as a "LOSS" or "Losses"), which may be incurred by or
asserted or awarded against any Purchaser Indemnified Party in connection with
or in any manner arising out of or relating to any investigation, litigation or
proceeding or the preparation of any defense with respect thereto, arising out
of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or any use made or
proposal to be made with the proceeds of Purchasers' purchase of the Convertible
Preferred Stock pursuant to this Agreement, whether or not such investigation,
litigation or proceeding is brought by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries,
shareholders or creditors, whether or not any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents are consummated, except to
the extent such Loss is found in a final judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction to have resulted from such Purchaser Indemnified Party's gross
negligence or willful misconduct.

               (b)   Each Purchaser severally agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless the Company and its Affiliates, and its respective officers, directors,
employees, agents, consultants, attorneys and advisers (each, a "COMPANY
INDEMNIFIED PARTY"), from and against any and all Losses, which may be incurred
by or asserted or awarded against any Company Indemnified Party in connection
with or in any manner arising out of or relating to any investigation,
litigation or proceeding or the preparation of any defense with respect thereto,
arising out of or in connection with or relating to any breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant made by such Purchaser in this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Purchaser shall be liable under this Section
9.10(b) for an amount in excess of that Purchaser's purchase price as set forth
on Exhibit A.

               (c)   An indemnified party shall give written notice to the
indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification
within ten (10) days after the discovery by such parties of any matters giving
arise to a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 9.10; provided
that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as provided herein
shall not relieve



                                     - 29 -

<PAGE>



the indemnifying party of its obligations under this Section 9.10, except to the
extent that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure to
give notice. In case any such action or claim is brought against any indemnified
party, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and, unless in
the reasonable good faith judgment of the indemnified party a conflict of
interest between such indemnified party and the indemnifying party may exist in
respect of such action or claim, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel
satisfactory to the indemnified party and after notice from the indemnifying
party to the indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof,
the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any
legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the latter in connection with
the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. In any event,
unless and until the indemnifying party elects in writing to assume and does so
assume the defense of any such action or claim the indemnified party's costs and
expenses arising out of the defense, settlement or compromise of any such action
or claim shall be Losses subject to indemnification hereunder. If the
indemnifying party elects to defend any such action or claim, then the
indemnified party shall be entitled to participate in such defense with counsel
of its choice at its sole cost and expense. The indemnifying party shall not be
liable for any settlement of any action or claim effected without its written
consent. Anything in this Section 9.10 to the contrary notwithstanding, the
indemnifying party shall not, without the indemnified party's prior written
consent, settle or compromise any claim or consent to entry of any judgment in
respect thereof that imposes any future obligation on the indemnified party or
that does not include, as an unconditional term thereof, the giving by the
claimant or the plaintiff to the indemnified party, a release from all liability
in respect of such claim.

         9.11   No Third-Party Beneficiaries.  Nothing in this Agreement will
confer any third party beneficiary or other rights upon any Person (specifically
including any employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries) or entity that is
not a party to this Agreement.

         (c) The Offshore General Partner shall cause to be filed, recorded and
published such statements, notices, certificates or other instruments (1) as may
be required by any provision of any applicable law that governs the formation of
the Partnership or the conduct of its activities from time to time or (2) as are

         SECTION 3.05. MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT. The Domestic General Partner, in
the name and on behalf of the Partnership, is authorized to enter into a
Management Agreement dated of even date herewith, in the form attached hereto as
Schedule B (the "MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT"), with Robert Fleming Inc. (the
"MANAGEMENT COMPANy"), with such Management Agreement to be subject to amendment
only with the consent of the Limited Partner and the limited partners of the
Domestic Partnership, voting together as a single class. If for any reason the
Management Agreement should terminate prior to the dissolution of the
Partnership, the Offshore General Partner shall (1) promptly give written
notification to the Limited Partner of such termination, (2) at the Domestic
General Partner's option, either contract with another management company, in
the name and on behalf of the Partnership, or arrange for the services
previously provided by the Management Company to be rendered directly by the
Domestic General Partner to the Partnership (subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 3.02), and (3) pay from Partnership funds on behalf of the
Partnership the fees and expenses incurred by the Partnership in clause 2 above.
The fee payable to the Management Company pursuant to the Management Agreement
(the "MANAGEMENT FEE") shall be paid by the Partnership and shall not (i) be
considered a distribution of profits or a return of capital to any General
Partner for any purpose under this Agreement or (ii) reduce the balance in any
Partner's Contributions Account, but shall constitute a Partnership expense to
be taken into account in determining Net Gain or Loss pursuant to Article X
hereof.

         SECTION 3.06.  SALARIES.

         (a) While the Management Agreement is in effect, the General Partners,
the partners of the General Partners and the members of the Domestic General
Partner's general partner shall receive no salaries from the Partnership. In the
event that the Management Agreement is terminated prior to dissolution and
completion of liquidation of the Partnership, after the date of such
termination, the partners of the General Partners and the members of the
Domestic General Partner's general partner shall be entitled to receive such
compensation from the Partnership as the Offshore General Partner may determine,
provided that, except as otherwise approved by the Limited Partner, the
aggregate amount of compensation paid annually by the Partnership to any Person
or Persons (under this Section 3.06(a) and clause 3 of the second sentence of
Section 3.05) for services of the type previously provided to the Partnership by
the Management

                                      - 6 -



<PAGE>






Company shall not exceed the Management Fee for the calendar year preceding the
year in which the Management Agreement was terminated.

         (b) Any partners of the General Partners and any members of the
Domestic General Partner's general partner shall be permitted to receive fees,
commissions or other compensation from Persons other than the Partnership;
provided, however, that so long as the Management Agreement is in effect, or the
services provided by the Management Company are provided by the Domestic General
Partner or an Affiliate of the Domestic General Partner, neither the General
Partner, nor any (1) partner of the Domestic General Partner, (2) member of the
Domestic General Partner's general partner, (3) officer, director or employee of
the Management Company, or (4) member of the Advisory Committee, shall receive
any directors' fees, consulting fees or other remuneration for services from any
Portfolio Company, except reimbursement for expenses.

         SECTION 3.07.  CO-INVESTMENT WITH DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIP.

         (a) The Domestic General Partner also is serving as the general partner
of the Domestic Partnership. It is the policy of the Partnership and the policy
of the Domestic Partnership to conduct their investment activities in parallel
(other than those activities involving the use of idle funds pending
investment). To implement this policy, the Domestic General Partner, to the
extent commercially reasonable, will:

                           (1)
                           apportion available investment  opportunities between
                  the Partnership and the Domestic  Partnership in proportion to
                  the  relative  amounts  of  capital  committed  to  each  such
                  partnership;

                           (2)
                           cause the Partnership and the Domestic Partnership to
                  sell  or  otherwise   dispose  of  each  such   investment  at
                  substantially  the  same  time and on  substantially  the same
                  terms in amounts  proportionate  to the  relative  size of the
                  investments   made  by  the   Partnership   and  the  Domestic
                  Partnership in the securities of that Portfolio Company; and

                           (3)
                           cause the Partnership or the Domestic  Partnership to
                  sell or buy from each other securities of Portfolio Companies,
                  at  cost,  so  as to  maintain  to  the  extent  feasible  the
                  relationship between the capital committed to each partnership
                  and the holdings of each partnership in the securities of each
                  Portfolio Company if the relative amounts of capital committed
                  to the Partnership and the Domestic

                                      - 7 -



<PAGE>






                  Partnership,  respectively,  should change between the Initial
                  Closing and the Final Closing.

         (b) The Partnership shall bear its proportionate share, based on the
relative amount it invests, of all expenses incurred in connection with each
investment made in parallel with the Domestic Partnership, but shall not bear
any expenses incurred solely for the benefit of the Domestic Partnership.

         SECTION 3.08.  OTHER ACTIVITIES.

         (a) The Domestic General Partner, and the general partner of the
Domestic General Partner and the members of the Domestic General Partner's
general partner shall devote such time and effort to the activities of the
Partnership as may be necessary to promote adequately the interests of the
Partnership and the mutual interests of the Partners. It is specifically
understood and agreed that time and effort devoted by the General Partners, the
general partner of the Domestic General Partner and the members of the Domestic
General Partner's general partner to the affairs of the Partnership, the
Domestic Partnership, the Management Company, the Limited Partner and any other
entity affiliated with the Partnership, including for this purpose any Portfolio
Company, shall be considered time and effort devoted to the activities of the
Partnership only to the extent it is in or not opposed to the best interests of
the Partnership.

         (b) It is specifically understood and agreed that, without the prior
written consent of a majority in interest of the Limited Partner of the
Partnership and the limited partners of the Domestic Partnership, voting
together as a single class, neither of the General Partners nor the general
partner of the Domestic General Partner and the members of the Domestic General
Partner's general partner shall act as a general partner or similar principal of
a private equity fund formed after the date hereof to pursue an investment
strategy similar to that of the Partnership (a "SUCCESSOR ENTITY") until the
earlier of (1) the date on which at least 75% of the Partnership's aggregate
Subscriptions has been invested, expended, committed to be invested, or reserved
for future investment in entities which at such time are already Portfolio
Companies or for reasonably anticipated Partnership expenses and liabilities or
(2) the end of the Commitment Period. Solely for purposes of determining whether
the 75% threshold has been met, the aggregate amount reserved for future
investment and for Partnership expenses and liabilities shall be subject to
approval of the Advisory Committee, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

         (c) Neither the Partnership nor any Partner shall by virtue of this
Agreement have any right, title or interest in or to any Successor Entity.

         SECTION 3.09. AVOIDANCE OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. The Partnership and
the Domestic Partnership have adopted the following policies to deal with
potential conflicts of interest.

         (a) Except for transactions that are specifically permitted under the
terms and provisions of this Agreement or as otherwise approved by the Advisory
Committee, the Partnership shall not engage in any investment or other financial
transaction with any Partner, or any partner of any Partner, other than
transactions entered into in the ordinary course of the Partnership's activities
on terms no less favorable to the Partnership than are generally afforded to
unrelated third parties in comparable transactions.

         (b) The partners, officers, directors, managers, members and employees
of the General Partners and their Affiliates may invest for their own accounts
in the securities of any Portfolio Company only on terms no better than those
available to the Partnership, and only after the General Partners have made
available to the Partnership all investment opportunities in such Portfolio
Companies which come to the attention of the General Partners and their
partners, except for such opportunities which the General Partners and their
partners reasonably believe are not within the purposes of or appropriate for
the Partnership.

         (c) The General Partners in their sole discretion may offer
co-investment opportunities to Shareholders of the Limited Partner who express
an interest in co-investment opportunities in writing. Such co-investment
opportunities shall be offered on terms identical or substantially similar to
the Partnership, and the General Partners intend to do so when possible and
appropriate. The General Partners shall not provide any investment advice to any
Shareholders of the Limited Partner with respect to any such co-investment
opportunity. Any Shareholder participating in any such co-investment opportunity
shall be responsible for making its own decision as to the merits of such
opportunity and the co-investment opportunity offered to any Shareholder shall
not contain a recommendation to any Shareholder that such investment is suitable
for the particular Shareholder. The Limited Partner hereby acknowledges and
agrees that the General Partners may also offer to other private investors,
groups, partnerships, or corporations, the right to participate in investment
opportunities made available to the Partnership whenever the General Partners,
in their discretion, so determine.

         (d) Each Partner agrees that any other Partner and its respective
partners, officers, directors, members, managers, employees and Affiliates may
invest, participate, or engage in (for their own accounts or for the accounts of
others), or may possess an interest in, other financial ventures and investment
and professional activities of every kind and description, independently or with
others and may receive fees, commissions, remuneration or reimbursement of
expenses in connection with these activities, whether or not such activities may
conflict with any interest of the Partnership or any of the Partners (provided,
that, the General Partners, the general partner

                                      - 9 -



<PAGE>






of the Domestic General Partner and the members of the Domestic General
Partner's general partner are further subject to Section 3.08 and the other
provisions of this Section 3.09). The parties hereto expressly agree that
neither the Partnership nor any Partner shall have any rights in or to
activities permitted by this Section 3.09(d) or to any fees, income, profits or
goodwill derived therefrom.

         SECTION 3.10. DUTY OF CARE. It is recognized that decisions concerning
investments or potential investments involve the exercise of judgment and the
risk of loss. The Domestic General Partner and its partners shall exercise their
best judgment in making investments on behalf of the Partnership and in carrying
out their other obligations hereunder and they shall not incur any liability for
effecting such investments all to the extent they are entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Section 18.01 hereof. The General Partners, their
partners (including each such partner's officers, directors, employees,
managers, members and agents), and their Affiliates shall not be liable to the
Partnership or any other Partner for honest mistakes of judgment or for losses
due to such mistakes or for the negligence, whether of omission or commission,
dishonesty or bad faith of any employee, broker or other agent of the
Partnership selected and retained by any of them with reasonable care. The
General Partners, their partners (including each such partner's officers,
directors, employees, managers, members and agents), and their Affiliates shall
be fully protected and justified with respect to any action or omission taken or
suffered by any of them in good faith if such action or omission is taken or
suffered in reliance upon and in accordance with the opinion or advice as to
matters of law of legal counsel, or as to matters of accounting of accountants,
or as to matters of valuation of investment bankers or appraisers, selected and
retained by any of them with reasonable care.

         SECTION 3.11.  INVESTMENT LIMITATIONS.

         (a) Without the prior approval of the Advisory Committee, the
Partnership shall not:

               (1) invest more than 15% of the aggregate Subscriptions of all
          Partners and subscriptions of all partners of the Domestic
          Partnership, in the securities of any single Portfolio Company
          (including, for this purpose, the outstanding balance of any
          indebtedness of such Portfolio Company that the Partnership has
          guaranteed);

               (2) invest more than 15% of the aggregate Subscriptions of all
          Partners and the subscriptions of all partners of the Domestic
          Partnership, in companies which, at the time of such investment, do
          not have any equity securities traded on a Public Securities Market;
          and

               (3) purchase on a Public Securities Market Portfolio Company
          equity securities if the Partnership's cumulative Cost of all such
          purchases held by the

                                     - 10 -



<PAGE>






         Partnership at such time would exceed 5% of the aggregate Subscriptions
         of all Partners and the subscriptions of all partners of the Domestic
         Partnership.

         (b) The Partnership shall not participate in (i) investments actively
opposed by the board of directors of the potential Portfolio Company; (ii)
investments in companies undergoing bankruptcy liquidations; or (iii)
investments in real estate.

         (c) The General Partners shall use their best efforts to cause the
Partnership to conduct its affairs in a manner that limits the Partnership's
operations to investments and other related activities which, taken together,
would not cause the Partnership to be treated for United States federal income
tax purposes as engaged in a "trade or business within the United States,"
within the meaning of Section 864(b) of the Code, during any taxable year of the
Partnership. Accordingly, the Partnership shall not:


         (1)
         acquire either any direct interest in United States real estate or any
         other interest, including an interest in a corporation, which would be
         treated as a "United States real property interest" within the meaning
         of Section 897(c) of the Code at the time of its acquisition by the
         Partnership;


         (2)
         acquire an interest in any partnership, trust or other non-corporate
         entity, unless (A) the Domestic General Partner determines, after
         consultation with counsel to the Partnership, that such proposed
         acquisition will not cause the Partnership to be treated as engaged in
         a trade or business within the United States for United States tax
         purposes, and (B) such entity agrees to be bound contractually by
         restrictions substantially similar to those set forth in this Section
         3.11(c);


         (3)
         acquire and dispose of securities or other assets on a regular and
         frequent basis with a view to realizing short-term gains from market
         fluctuations; provided, however, that the Partnership (A) may make
         temporary investments of its funds not yet invested in securities of
         Portfolio Companies or used to pay Partnership expenses, and (B) shall
         attempt to minimize the frequency of such investment transactions and
         otherwise to conduct such temporary investment activity in a prudent
         and conservative manner consistent with the Partnership's objectives as
         set forth in Section 2.03;

                                     - 11 -



<PAGE>







         (4)
         invest in or enter into contracts for the purchase or sale of
         commodities;


         (5)
         invest in options or futures, including currency futures, other than
         options or other contracts for the acquisition of securities of a
         Portfolio Company;


         (6)
         make any investment with borrowed funds; provided, however, that the
         limitation set forth in this Section 3.11(c)(6) shall not preclude the
         Partnership from borrowing on a short-term basis or guaranteeing the
         obligations of a Portfolio Company, each to the extent permitted by
         Section 3.12; or


         (7)
         engage in or hold itself out as engaging in the performance of services
         for compensation, or otherwise carry on directly a trade or business.

         (d) The restrictions set forth in Section 3.11(c) are intended to
ensure that the activities of the Partnership will be conducted so as to avoid
United States federal income taxation on the income of the Partnership allocated
to the Limited Partner (other than withholding tax on dividends and certain
interest payments received from United States sources). To this end, in addition
to complying with the specific restrictions set forth in Section 3.11(c), the
General Partners shall use their best efforts, to the extent practicable and
consistent with the Partnership's investment program:


         (1)
         not to engage in any activity that would subject the income of the
         Partnership allocated to the Limited Partner to United States federal
         income taxation (other than withholding tax on dividends and certain
         interest payments received from United States sources); and


         (2)
         in the event that the Code or the regulations promulgated thereunder
         are from time to time amended so as to require additional or different
         restrictions on Partnership activities

                                     - 12 -



<PAGE>






         and  investments in order to avoid such taxation, to observe such
         additional or different restrictions.

               Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that legislative,
judicial or regulatory changes occurring after the date hereof may cause
Partners that are not United States Persons to become subject to United States
federal, state or local income tax on their respective shares of capital gains
realized by the Partnership that are not effectively connected with a trade or
business within the United States, within the meaning of Section 864 of the
Code, carried on by the Partnership, whether such income taxes are collected by
withholding or otherwise, the preceding sentence shall not apply with respect to
any such taxes.

         (e) In making temporary investments of idle Partnership funds, the
Domestic General Partner shall use its best efforts to make such investments so
as to minimize withholding of United States income tax at the source with
respect to the shares of Partnership income and gains allocable to the Limited
Partner. In this connection, the Domestic General Partner shall not invest in
regulated investment companies that elect to be subject to Part I of Subchapter
M of the Code.

         SECTION 3.12. BORROWING AND GUARANTEES. The Partnership may engage in
borrowing, but only on a short-term basis pending its receipt of Additional
Capital Contributions from the Partners. The Partnership may guarantee the
indebtedness of any Portfolio Company; provided, however, that except with the
consent of the Advisory Committee, the total amount guaranteed by the
Partnership at any one time with respect to all Portfolio Companies shall not
exceed 10% of the aggregate Subscriptions of all Partners.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                                 LIMITED PARTNER

         SECTION 4.01. NAME, ADDRESS AND SUBSCRIPTION. The name and address of
the Limited Partner and its Subscription is set forth in Schedule A hereto.
Schedule A shall be amended from time to time to reflect any change in the
identity or the Subscriptions of the Partners or the aggregate Subscriptions of
all Partners made in accordance with this Agreement, and no such revision shall
constitute an amendment of this Agreement.

         SECTION 4.02. LIMITED LIABILITY. The liability of the Limited Partner
to the Partnership shall be limited to any unpaid capital contributions which it
agreed to make to the Partnership, except as otherwise provided under Bermuda
law. The Partners acknowledge and agree that the Management Fee shall be payable
by the Partnership out of Partnership assets and will not be paid directly by
the Partners to the Management Company.

part in the control/management of the affairs of the Partnership, or undertake
any transactions on behalf of the Partnership, or have any power to sign for or
to bind the Partnership.

         (b) The Limited Partner shall not have the right or power to: (1)
withdraw or reduce its contribution to the capital of the Partnership except as
a result of the dissolution of the Partnership (provided that such Limited
Partner shall have no right to withdraw or reduce its contributions on
dissolution of the Partnership to the extent that the Partnership requires funds
to pay its creditors) or as otherwise provided herein; (2) cause the termination
and dissolution of the Partnership, other than the right specified in Section
13.03; or (3) demand or receive property other than cash in return for its
contribution except as otherwise provided herein.

         SECTION 4.04. DEATH, DISSOLUTION OR BANKRUPTCY. The death,
incompetence, bankruptcy, liquidation or dissolution of the Limited Partner
shall not result in the termination of the Partnership, but the rights of such
Limited Partner under this Agreement shall accrue to such Limited Partner's
successor, estate or legal representative. Except as expressly provided in this
Agreement, no other event affecting the Limited Partner (including but not
limited to insolvency) shall affect this Agreement.

                                    ARTICLE V

                            EXPENSES; MANAGEMENT FEE

         SECTION 5.01. ORGANIZATIONAL EXPENSES. Upon execution of this
Agreement, the Partnership shall reimburse the General Partners for all
reasonable expenses incurred by the General Partners and their Affiliates that
are attributable to the organization of the Partnership and the sale of
interests in the Partnership to the Limited Partner, including the organization
of the Limited Partner; provided, however, that the organizational expenses of
the Partnership and the Domestic Partnership shall not exceed $500,000 in the
aggregate. The General Partners shall allocate such organizational expenses to
the Partnership or the Domestic Partnership to the extent such expenses can be
reasonably attributed to one of such funds and not the other. Any remaining
organizational expenses shall be allocated between the Partnership and the
Domestic Partnership in proportion to their respective total Subscriptions. Any
such expenses shall be paid by the Partnership and shall not reduce the balance
in any Partner's Contributions Account. Neither the Partnership nor the Limited
Partner shall be responsible for paying any syndication, brokerage, placement or
similar fee required to be paid to Merrill Lynch & Co. on behalf of the Limited
Partner. Such fee, if any, shall be paid by the General Partners or an Affiliate
thereof.

         SECTION 6.01. APPOINTMENT AND VACANCIEs. The Partnership and the
Domestic Partnership shall have the same advisory committee (to be formed after
the date of the Initial Closing) which shall consist of at least three members
and no more than five members appointed by the Domestic General Partner and who

         SECTION 6.03. DUTIES. To the extent permitted under Bermuda law for
Persons that do not thereby become liable to any party as general partners of

to review and approve of proposed Partnership investments to the extent required
by Section 3.11, and to review certain valuations of Partnership assets.

         SECTION 6.04. VOTING; RULES AND PROCEDURES. All approvals,
disapprovals, vetoes and other actions taken by the Advisory Committee shall be
authorized by a majority of its members then holding office. The Advisory

Partner which arises out of any action or omission of such member, provided that
(1) such member determined, in good faith, that such course of conduct was in,
or not opposed to, the best interest of the Partnership and, with respect to any
criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such Person's
conduct was unlawful, and (2) such course of conduct did not constitute gross
negligence or willful misconduct of such member. The Advisory Committee and each
member thereof shall be fully protected and justified with respect to any action
or omission taken or suffered by any of them in good faith if such action or
omission is taken or suffered in reliance upon and in accordance with the
opinion or advice as to matters of law of legal counsel, or as to matters of
accounting of accountants, or as to matters of valuation of investment bankers
or appraisers, selected by any of them with reasonable care. In addition, each
member of the Advisory Committee shall be entitled to indemnification by the
Partnership to the extent provided in Article XVIII hereof.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                            ADDITIONAL SUBSCRIPTIONS

         SECTION 7.01. ADDITIONAL SUBSCRIPTIONS WITHIN 180 DAYS AFTER INITIAL
CLOSING. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, during the period
commencing on the date of the Initial Closing until and through the date that is
180 days thereafter (the "Final Closing"), the Offshore General Partner is
authorized, but not obligated, to accept from time to time additional
Subscriptions from the Limited Partner. Any such additional Subscriptions shall
be accepted only if: (a) the Limited Partner contributes or pays, on or before
the date of its additional Subscription, all amounts required by Section 8.05
hereof; (b) no distribution has been made by the Partnership to the Partners
pursuant to Article XI prior to the date of the Limited Partner's additional
Subscription other than a distribution described in Sections 8.05 and 11.06; and
(c) after the acceptance of such additional Subscriptions, the sum of the
aggregate Subscriptions of all Partners and the aggregate capital commitments of
all partners of the Domestic Partnership to the Domestic Partnership does not
exceed $250 million. The Offshore General Partner shall

                                     - 16 -



<PAGE>



cause Schedule A to be amended from time to time, without the consent of any
other Partner, to reflect any changes in the Subscriptions or identity of any
Partner or the aggregate Subscriptions of all Partners including any increase in
the Subscriptions of the General Partners which is accepted contemporaneously
with the acceptance of additional Subscriptions from the Limited Partner.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                           CAPITAL OF THE PARTNERSHIP

         SECTION 8.01.  CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS.

         (a) The capital of the Partnership shall consist initially of the
initial capital contributions of the Partners, as set forth in Schedule A, which
amount shall equal in the aggregate 10% of each Partner's Subscription. In
addition, each Partner shall make additional contributions to the capital of the
Partnership ("ADDITIONAL CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS"), upon no less than 10 days'
prior written notice from the Offshore General Partner, so as to increase the
aggregate amount of its contributions to the Partnership to an amount equal to
such Partner's Subscription. Each such notice shall set forth the date on which
the related Additional Capital Contribution is due and shall include a general
description of the purposes and uses for which the Additional Capital
Contributions are being called including, for example, the payment of
Partnership expenses (including the Management Fee) and the purchase of
Portfolio Securities; provided that the Offshore General Partner shall not be
required to identify the purposes and uses of 100% of any Additional Capital
Contribution or be required to identify the name of any particular Portfolio
Company or proposed Portfolio Company. The amount of capital required to be
contributed by each Partner on each occasion of an Additional Capital
Contribution shall be computed by the Offshore General Partner so that each
Partner's Additional Capital Contribution bears the same relationship to the
aggregate Additional Capital Contributions to be made on such occasion as such
Partner's Subscription bears to the aggregate Subscriptions of all Partners. All
calls for contributions of additional capital by the Partners and the partners
of the Domestic Partnership to their respective partnerships shall be made on an
as-needed basis at the same times and on substantially the same terms. All
capital contributions shall be made in cash in United States dollars.

         (b) From and after the end of the Commitment Period (as defined below),
the Limited Partner shall be released from any obligation to make Additional
Capital Contributions as provided for in Section 8.01(a) except to the extent
necessary to (i) pay the expenses and liabilities of the Partnership, including
the Management Fee, (ii) complete investments by the Partnership in respect of
transactions committed to by the Partnership prior to the end of the Commitment
Period and (iii) make follow-on investments in Portfolio Companies provided that

                                     - 17 -



<PAGE>






the aggregate amount of such follow-on investments shall not exceed 20% of the
aggregate Subscriptions of all Partners. The "COMMITMENT PERIOD" shall commence
on the date of the Initial Closing and shall end on the fourth anniversary date
of the Initial Closing; provided, that, if Robert L. Burr and any one of
Christopher M.V. Jones, Eytan M. Shapiro and Timothy R.V. Parton are no longer
active in the affairs of the Partnership and the General Partners do not replace
such Persons within 60 days thereafter with investment manager(s) acceptable to
the Limited Partner, as directed by a majority in interest of the Shareholders
of the Limited Partner, then the Limited Partner, by vote of the Limited
Partner, as directed by two-thirds in interest of the Shareholders of the
Limited Partner, taken within 45 days after the end of such 60 day period, may
cause the Commitment Period to end prior to the fourth anniversary of the date
of the Initial Closing (provided that the limited partners of the Domestic
Partnership simultaneously cause the commitment period of the Domestic
Partnership to end).

         (c) The Offshore General Partner may at any time, by written notice to
the Limited Partner, terminate in whole or in part the obligation of the
Partners to make Additional Capital Contributions and, upon the giving of such
notice, the obligation of the Partners to make such contributions shall
terminate to the extent specified in such notice. Any partial termination of the
outstanding obligations of the Partners to make Additional Capital Contributions
shall be accomplished by terminating in part the obligations of all Partners,
pro rata in proportion to their respective Subscriptions. The Offshore General
Partner shall not cause any termination of the Partners' obligation to make
Additional Capital Contributions unless a substantially equivalent termination
occurs contemporaneously with respect to the obligations of the partners of the
Domestic Partnership to make additional capital contributions to the Domestic
Partnership. In the event that the Offshore General Partner terminates, in whole
or in part, the obligations of the Partners to make Additional Capital
Contributions, each Partner's Subscription shall be reduced accordingly as of
the date that written notice of such termination is delivered to the Partners.

         SECTION 8.02.  FAILURE TO MAKE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS.

         (a) In the event that any Partner fails to pay any amount which it is
required to pay to the Partnership on or before the date when such amount is due
and payable, it shall be deemed to be in default hereunder (a "DEFAULTING
PARTNER") and a notice of default shall be given to it by express courier
service, facsimile transmission, air mail or certified or registered mail.

         (b) If the full amount of such payment is not received by the
Partnership within 45 days after the delivery of such notice, as liquidated and
agreed upon current damages for such default (it being agreed that it would be
difficult or impossible to fix the actual damages), the Partnership shall have
the option, exercisable by the Offshore General Partner in its sole discretion
by mailing notice thereof to the Defaulting Partner, to reduce each of the
Defaulting

                                     - 18 -



<PAGE>






Partner's Contributions Account and Capital Account established pursuant to
Sections 9.01 and 9.02, respectively, by an amount equal to 50% of such
Defaulting Partner's Subscription at the time of the default (the "DEFAULT
CHARGE"). The amount of any Default Charge levied upon a Defaulting Partner
shall immediately become unrestricted monies of the Partnership and shall be
allocated to and among the respective Contributions Accounts of the
non-defaulting Partners in such proportion as the Contributions Account of each
such non-defaulting Partner then bears to the sum of the Contributions Accounts
of all non-defaulting Partners; and to and among the respective Capital Accounts
of the non-defaulting Partners in such proportion as the Capital Account of each
such non-defaulting Partner then bears to the sum of the Capital Accounts of all
non-defaulting Partners. For purposes of the preceding sentence: (1) the amount
by which a Defaulting Partner's Contributions Account or Capital Account is
reduced shall in no case exceed the positive balance in such Defaulting
Partner's Contributions Account or Capital Account, respectively, immediately
before the reduction; (2) if either of the Capital Account or the Contributions
Account of the Defaulting Partner otherwise would be reduced below zero by the
imposition of the full amount of any Default Charge, such account shall be
reduced to zero and any excess of the full amount of the Default Charge over the
positive balance in such account immediately before such reduction shall be
carried over and applied to reduce the balance in such account at such
subsequent time or times as such account has a positive balance; and (3) any
increase in the Capital Accounts or Contributions Accounts of non-defaulting
Partners as the result of the imposition of a Default Charge shall occur only at
such time or times as the corresponding reductions in the Defaulting Partner's
accounts occur.

         (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, (1) any Defaulting Partner that does not make full payment to the
Partnership of all amounts due and payable to the Partnership on or before the
date that is 45 days after notice of a default was mailed to such Partner as
provided in Section 8.02(a) shall not receive any distributions from the
Partnership until such time as the Partnership makes its final liquidating
distribution pursuant to Article XIV; and (2) any distributions that otherwise
would be made to a Defaulting Partner during such 45-day period shall be made to
such Defaulting Partner at the end of such 45-day period if, before the end of
such period, the Defaulting Partner has paid to the Partnership all amounts then
due and payable.

         (d) The application of the aforesaid liquidated damages provision shall
not relieve any Defaulting Partner of such Partner's obligation to make all
subsequent Additional Capital Contributions when due unless the Offshore General
Partner, in its sole discretion, determines that no further Additional Capital
Contribution shall be accepted from the Defaulting Partner and notifies such
Defaulting Limited Partner in writing. As of the date that such notice is sent
to the Defaulting Partner, such Defaulting Partner's Subscription shall be
reduced by an amount equal to the excess of such Defaulting Partner's original
Subscription over the aggregate paid-in capital

                                     - 19 -



<PAGE>






contributions of such Defaulting Partner. In the event that the balances in each
of the Capital Account and the Contributions Account of any Defaulting Partner
have been reduced to zero and either (1) each Partner (other than any Defaulting
Partner) has contributed to the Partnership the full amount of such Partner's
Subscription, or (2) the Offshore General Partner has determined that such
Defaulting Partner shall not be permitted to make any subsequent Additional
Capital Contribution to the Partnership, such Defaulting Partner's interest in
the Partnership shall be extinguished completely and the Partnership shall have
no further obligation of any nature to such Person. Except as expressly set
forth herein, no Partner may contribute to the Partnership less than the full
amount of such Partner's Subscription.

         (e) Notwithstanding any other language in this Section 8.02, if the
Limited Partner is deemed to be a Defaulting Partner in accordance with this
Section 8.02 on account of the failure of a Shareholder to make a call required
by the Limited Partner's bye-laws, the provisions of Section 8.02 shall apply to
such Shareholder's sub-Contributions Account and sub-Capital Account established
pursuant to Section 9.05, and any allocations of unrestricted monies of the
Partnership pursuant to Section 8.02(b) shall be made to and among the General
Partners' Contributions Accounts and Capital Accounts and each of the other
Shareholders' sub- Contributions Accounts and sub-Capital Accounts. Upon the
default of any Shareholder in making a call to the Limited Partner and a
corresponding default by the Limited Partner in making Additional Capital
Contributions to the Partnership pursuant to Section 8.01, this Section 8.02
shall be interpreted and applied as necessary to ensure, to the extent feasible,
that only the defaulting Shareholder and no other Shareholder of the Limited
Partner is adversely affected by the imposition of any Default Charge
attributable to the defaulting Shareholder's default.

         SECTION 8.03. NO INTEREST OR WITHDRAWALS. No interest shall accrue on
any capital contribution made by a Partner, and no Partner shall have the right
to withdraw or to be repaid any of its capital contributions so made, except as
specifically provided in this Agreement.

         SECTION 8.04. MINIMUM CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF GENERAL PARTNERS. The
General Partners shall contribute capital to the Partnership at such times and
in such amounts as necessary to ensure that the paid-in capital contributions of
the General Partners are at all times equal in the aggregate to at least 1.01%
of the paid-in capital contributions of the Limited Partner at such time.

         SECTION 8.05. CONTRIBUTIONS AND PAYMENTS ON ADDITIONAL SUBSCRIPTIONS.

         (a) Upon the acceptance of any additional Subscriptions in accordance
with . Section 7.01 hereof: (i) the General Partners shall amend or supplement
Schedule A hereto to reflect the additional Subscriptions of the Limited
Partner; (ii) the additional Subscriptions shall

                                     - 20 -



<PAGE>






be included thereafter in the Partnership's aggregate Subscriptions; and (iii)
the Subscriptions of the General Partners shall be increased (if necessary) to
the amount then required by Section 8.04.

         (b) The Limited Partner shall pay to the Partnership, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, on each date of its additional Subscription the
following amounts (which amounts in clause (ii) and (iii) shall not constitute
part of the Additional Capital Contributions of the Limited Partner):

               (i) a capital contribution representing the same percentage of
               its additional Subscription as the percentage which the Limited
               Partner had been required to contribute of its Subscription prior
               to such date (treating, for this purpose, any amounts previously
               returned to the Limited Partner pursuant to Section 8.05(c)(i),
               and any amount required to be so returned upon the acceptance of
               such additional Subscriptions, as if such amounts had not been
               previously contributed by the Limited Partner);


               (ii) an amount equal to interest that would have been earned if
               the dollar amount of such additional Subscription's proportionate
               share of the capital contributions previously used to make
               investments in Portfolio Companies (unless in the discretion of
               the General Partners there has been a material change or
               significant event relating to a Portfolio Company which would
               justify a different amount), had been invested at an interest
               rate equal to the Prime Rate plus two percent (2%) per annum,
               compounded annually, for the period from such investment to the
               date of such acceptance of additional Subscriptions from the
               Limited Partner; and


               (iii) an additional amount equal to the interest that would have
               been earned if the dollar amount of the additional payment of the
               Management Fee made by the Partnership to the Management Company
               at the time of the acceptance of such additional Subscriptions
               had been invested at an interest rate equal to the Prime Rate per
               annum, compounded annually, for the period from the Initial
               Closing to the date of the acceptance of such additional
               Subscriptions. The Partnership shall remit such additional
               amounts to the Management Company as provided in Section 5.02.


         (c) Upon the acceptance of an additional Subscription, the Partnership
shall distribute to the Partners:


                                     - 21 -



<PAGE>






               (i) an amount equal to such additional Subscription's
               proportionate share of the capital contributions previously used
               to make investment in Portfolio Companies, which shall be
               apportioned among such previously admitted Partners (which such
               Limited Partner shall apportion among its Shareholders of record
               prior to such date), in proportion to their respective
               contributions and shall increase on a dollar-for-dollar basis the
               Additional Capital Contributions required to be made by each
               Partner pursuant to Section 8.01 and correspondingly decrease
               each Partner's Contributions Account; and


               (ii) an amount equal to the additional payment made by the
               Limited Partner pursuant to Section 8.05(b)(ii), which shall not
               increase the Additional Capital Contributions required to be made
               by any Partner pursuant to Section 8.01.


         (d) Each Partner acknowledges and agrees that the intent of this
Section 8.05 is to allow each additional Shareholder of the Limited Partner to
obtain an indirect interest (based on its increase in the Limited Partner's
Subscription) in each investment in a Portfolio Company previously made by the
Partnership at the time of such additional Subscription and to cause each
additional Shareholder of the Limited Partner to bear its proportionate
additional share of the Management Fee paid prior to the acceptance of such
additional Subscriptions, in each case in exchange for the payments required
under this Section 8.05.

         (e) For purposes of the provisions of Sections 8.05(b)(ii) and
8.05(b)(iii), the acceptance of additional Subscriptions after the Initial
Closing from the Limited Partner with respect to any existing Shareholder of the
Limited Partner who became a Shareholder of the Limited Partner prior to the
Final Closing, shall not require the Limited Partner to make any additional
payments pursuant to clauses (ii) or (iii) of Section 8.05(b) if and to the
extent that such additional Subscription results from the original terms or
formula by which such existing Shareholder of the Limited Partner's subscription
for Preference Shares was calculated and is made in order to allow such existing
Shareholder of the Limited Partner to maintain its percentage interest in the
Limited Partner.

                                    ACCOUNTS

         SECTION 9.01. CONTRIBUTIONS ACCOUNTS. There shall be established on the
books of the Partnership a capital contributions account ("CONTRIBUTIONS
ACCOUNT") for each Partner

                                     - 22 -

which shall consist of such Partner's initial capital contribution to the
Partnership made pursuant to this Agreement, (a) increased by (1) any Additional
Capital Contributions made by such Partner, and (2) any part of a Default Charge
added to the Contributions Account of such Partner pursuant to Section 8.02; and
(b) decreased by (1) any Default Charge subtracted from the Contributions
Account of such Partner pursuant to Section 8.02 and (2) any distribution
pursuant to Section 8.05(c)(i). Except as provided in the preceding sentence, a
Partner's Contributions Account shall not be reduced on account of any
distributions of capital to such Partner or for any other reason.

         SECTION 9.02. CAPITAL ACCOUNTS. There shall be established on the books
of the Partnership a capital account ("CAPITAL ACCOUNT") for each Partner that
shall consist of such Partner's initial capital contribution to the Partnership
made pursuant to this Agreement, (a) increased by (1) any Additional Capital
Contributions made by such Partner, (2) any part of a Default Charge added to
the Capital Account of such Partner pursuant to Section 8.02, and (3) any
amounts from time to time added to the Capital Account of such Partner pursuant
to Article X; (b) decreased by (1) any distributions made to such Partner
including pursuant to Section 8.05(c)(1), (2) any Default Charge subtracted from
the Capital Account of such Partner pursuant to Section 8.02, and (3) any
amounts subtracted from the Capital Account of such Partner pursuant to Article
X; and (c) otherwise adjusted in accordance with the tax accounting principles
set forth in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv). For these purposes,
Net Gain allocated to any Partner shall be added to, and Net Loss and Loss Items
so allocated shall be subtracted from, such Partner's Capital Account.

         SECTION 9.03. ACCOUNTING FOR DISTRIBUTIONS IN KIND. For purposes of
maintaining Capital Accounts when Partnership property is distributed in kind,
(a) the Partnership shall treat such property as if it had been sold for its
fair market value on the date of distribution as determined in accordance with
Article XII; (b) any difference between the fair market value of such property
as so determined and the Cost of such property shall constitute Net Gain or Loss
attributable to such distribution and shall be allocated to the Capital Accounts
of the Partners pursuant to Article X; and (c) all property distributed in kind
by the Partnership to a Partner shall be debited to that Partner's Capital
Account at the fair market value of such property on the date of distribution
(net of any liabilities secured by such distributed property that such Partner
is considered to assume or take subject to under Section 752 of the Code).

         SECTION 9.04. COMPLIANCE WITH TREASURY REGULATIONS. The foregoing
provisions and the other provisions of this Agreement relating to the
maintenance of Capital Accounts are intended to comply with Section 704(b) of
the Code and Treasury Regulations Section 1.704- 1(b), and shall be interpreted
and applied in a manner consistent with such regulations. In the event that the
Offshore General Partner shall determine that it is prudent to modify the manner
in

                                     - 23 -



<PAGE>






which the Capital Accounts, or any debits or credits thereto, are computed in
order to comply with such regulations, the Offshore General Partner may make
such modification, provided that it is not likely to have a material effect on
the amounts distributable to any Partner pursuant to Articles XI or XIV hereof.

         SECTION 9.05 LIMITED PARTNER SUB-ACCOUNTS. The Partnership shall
maintain sub- accounts with respect to the Limited Partner's Contributions
Account and Capital Account in order to reflect each Shareholder's beneficial
interest in the Partnership.

                                   ALLOCATIONS

         SECTION 10.01. GENERAL. Partnership income, gain, loss, deductions and
expenses shall be allocated to the Capital Accounts of the Partners in

         SECTION 10.02. NET GAIN. As of the end of each fiscal year of the

fiscal year shall be allocated to the Capital Accounts of the Partners as
follows:

         (a) First, to all Partners, in proportion to the amounts of Net Loss
(if any) previously allocated to each such Partner pursuant to Section 10.03(d)
and not offset by prior allocations of Net Gain made pursuant to this Section
10.02(a), an amount of Net Gain equal to the aggregate amount of such Net Loss;

         (b) Second, to the extent of any Net Gain remaining after allocations
pursuant to Section 10.02(a), to all Partners, in proportion to each Partner's
respective 8% Preferential Return Allocation, an amount of Net Gain equal to the
aggregate amount of such 8% Preferential Return Allocations;

         (c) Third, to the extent of any Net Gain remaining after allocations
pursuant to Sections 10.02(a) and 10.02(b):

                 (1)
                  if the Partnership is not in an 8% Payback Period, 100% to all
                  Partners in proportion to their respective Contributions
                  Accounts; and

                  (2)
                  if the Partnership is in an 8% Payback Period, 100% to the
                  Domestic General

                                     - 24 -



<PAGE>






                  Partner until the Domestic General Partner has received
                  allocations of Net Gain pursuant to this Section 10.02(c)(2)
                  and Sections 10.02(d) and 10.06 (net of offsetting allocations
                  of Net Loss and Loss Items) equal in the aggregate to its 20%
                  Subordinate Gain Allocation; and

         (d) Fourth, to the extent of any Net Gain remaining after allocations
pursuant to Sections 10.02(a), 10.02(b) and 10.02(c), 80% to all Partners in
proportion to their respective Contributions Accounts and 20% to the Domestic
General Partner.

         SECTION 10.03. NET LOSS. As of the end of each fiscal year of the
Partnership and after giving effect to the special allocations set forth in
Sections 10.05 and 10.06, the Net Loss (if any) of the Partnership for such

follows:

         (a) First, to all Partners, in proportion to the respective amounts of
Net Gain (if any) previously allocated to each such Partner pursuant to Section
10.02(d) and not offset by prior allocations of Net Loss made pursuant to this
Section 10.03(a) or Loss Items pursuant to Section 10.05, an amount of Net Loss
equal to the aggregate amount of such Net Gain (if any).

         (b) Second, to the extent of any Net Loss remaining after allocations
pursuant to Section 10.03(a):

                  (1)
                  to the Domestic General Partner, an amount of Net Loss equal
                  to the aggregate amount of Net Gain previously allocated to
                  the Domestic General Partner pursuant to Section 10.02(c)(2)
                  and not offset by prior allocations of Net Loss made pursuant
                  to this Section 10.03(b)(1) or Loss Items pursuant to Section
                  10.05; and then

                  (2)
                  to all Partners, in proportion to the respective amounts of
                  Net Gain (if any) previously allocated to each Partner
                  pursuant to Section 10.02(c)(1) and not offset by prior
                  allocations of Net Loss made pursuant to this Section

pursuant to Sections 10.03(a) and 10.03(b), to all Partners, in proportion to
the respective amounts of Net Gain (if any) previously allocated to each Partner

                                     - 25 -



<PAGE>






prior  allocations  of Net Loss made  pursuant to this Section  10.03(c) or Loss
Items  pursuant to Section  10.05,  an amount of Net Loss equal to the aggregate
amount of such Net Gain.

         (d) Fourth, to the extent of any Net Loss remaining after allocations
pursuant to Section 10.03(a), 10.03(b) and 10.03(c), to all Partners in
proportion to their respective Contributions Accounts.

         SECTION 10.04. DISTRIBUTIONS IN KIND. Net Gain or Loss attributable to
a distribution of Partnership property in kind shall be allocated, immediately
prior to the time such distribution is made, to the Partners' Capital Accounts
on the same basis as an equivalent amount of Net Gain or Loss would be allocated
for a hypothetical fiscal year ending immediately prior to such distribution.
For this purpose, there shall be taken into account any Net Gain or Loss
attributable to distributions in kind previously made during the fiscal year,
but there shall not be taken into account other items of Partnership income,
gain, loss or deduction realized or incurred since the end of the prior fiscal
year (such items being taken into account and allocated to Partners' Capital
Accounts as Net Gain, Net Loss or Loss Items only at the end of the fiscal year
in which they are realized or incurred).

         SECTION 10.05.  OPERATIONAL RULES.

         (a) If, for any fiscal period, Net Gain is available to be allocated to
the Partners but (1) an allocation of all of such Net Gain pursuant to Section
10.02 for such fiscal period would not be sufficient to provide each Partner
with such Partner's full 8% Preferential Return Allocation for such fiscal
period, and (2) any allocation of Net Gain for any prior fiscal period has been
made pursuant to Sections 10.02(c)(2) or 10.02(d) but not previously offset by
allocations of Net Loss pursuant to Sections 10.03(a) or 10.03(b)(1) or Loss
Items pursuant to this Section 10.05, then:

                  (A)

                  Loss Items for such fiscal period shall be allocated (subject
                  to the remainder of this Article X) to all Partners, in
                  proportion to the respective amounts of Net Gain previously
                  allocated to each such Partner pursuant to Sections
                  10.02(c)(2) or 10.02(d) and not previously offset by
                  allocations of Net Loss made pursuant to Sections 10.03(a) or
                  10.03(b)(1) or Loss Items pursuant to this Section 10.05, in
                  an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of the aggregate
                  amount of such Loss Items or the aggregate amount of such Net
                  Gain, with such Loss Items allocated among the Partners to
                  offset such allocations of Net Gain in the order in which such
                  allocations of Net Gain previously were made; and

                                     - 26 -



<PAGE>






                  (B)
                  the Net Gain of the Partnership for such fiscal period,
                  determined solely for this purpose by excluding all Loss Items
                  specially allocated pursuant to this Section 10.05 with
                  respect to such fiscal period, shall then be allocated
                  pursuant to Section 10.02.

         (b) If, for any fiscal period which is a 8% Payback Period, Net Gain is
available to be allocated to the Partners but (1) an allocation of all of such
Net Gain pursuant to Section 10.02 for such fiscal period would be insufficient
to provide the Domestic General Partner with its full 20% Subordinate Gain
Allocation, and (2) any allocation of Net Gain for any prior fiscal period has
been made pursuant to Section 10.02(d) but not previously offset by allocations
of Net Loss pursuant to Section 10.03(a) or Loss Items pursuant to this Section
10.05, then:

                  (A)
                  Loss Items for such fiscal period shall be allocated (subject
                  to the remainder of this Article X) to all Partners, in
                  proportion to the respective amounts of Net Gain previously
                  allocated to each such Partner pursuant to Section 10.02(d)
                  and not previously offset by allocations of Net Loss made
                  pursuant to Section 10.03(a) or Loss Items pursuant to this
                  Section 10.05, in an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of
                  the aggregate amount of such Loss Items or the aggregate
                  amount of such Net Gain, with such Loss Items allocated among
                  the Partners to offset such allocations of Net Gain in the
                  order in which such allocations of Net Gain previously were
                  made; and

                  (B)
                  the Net Gain of the Partnership for such fiscal period,
                  determined solely for this purpose by excluding all Loss Items
                  specially allocated pursuant to this Section 10.05 with
                  respect to such fiscal period, shall then be allocated
                  pursuant to Section 10.02.

         SECTION 10.06. REGULATORY ALLOCATIONS. The following provisions are
included in order to comply with tax rules set forth in the Code and to permit
the Partnership to obtain the benefits of a "SAFE HARBOR" provided by Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d).

         (a) If and to the extent that any allocation of Net Loss or Loss Items
(or portion thereof) to any Partner would cause such Partner's Capital Account
to be negative by an amount which exceeds such Partner's Restoration Amount then
such loss (or portion thereof) shall be allocated first to the Capital Accounts
of the other Partners in proportion to the positive balances in their respective
Capital Accounts until all such Capital Accounts are reduced to zero, then to
the Capital Accounts of Partners with Restoration Amounts, in proportion to
their respective

                                     - 27 -



<PAGE>






Restoration Amounts, until each such Partner's Capital Account is negative by an
amount equal to such Partner's Restoration Amount, and then to the Capital
Accounts of the General Partners in proportion to their relative Contributions
Accounts; provided that an allocation pursuant to this Section 10.06(a) shall be
made only if and to the extent that the deficit in such Partner's Capital
Account would exceed such Partner's Restoration Amount after all allocations
provided for in this Article X have been made tentatively as if Section 10.06
hereof were not included in this Agreement.

         (b) If any Partner unexpectedly receives an adjustment, allocation or
distribution described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4),
(5) or (6), and such adjustment, allocation or distribution causes such Partner
to have a deficit balance in such Partner's Capital Account that exceeds such
Partner's Restoration Amount or would further reduce a balance in such Partner's
Capital Account that is already negative by an amount which exceeds such
Partner's Restoration Amount, there shall be allocated to such Partner items of
income and gain (consisting of a pro rata portion of each item of Partnership
income, including gross income, and gain for such fiscal period) in an amount
and manner sufficient to eliminate such Partner's deficit Capital Account
balance, to the extent required by Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d), as quickly as possible; provided that an allocation
pursuant to this Section 10.06(b) shall be made only if and to the extent that
the deficit in such Partner's Capital Account would exceed such Partner's
Restoration Amount after all allocations provided for in this Article X have
been made tentatively as if this Section 10.06(b) were not included in this
Agreement. The foregoing sentence is intended to constitute a "qualified income
offset" provision as described in Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d), and shall be interpreted and applied in all respects in
accordance with that Section.

         (c) In the event that any Partner has a negative Capital Account at the
end of any Partnership fiscal year which is in excess of such Partner's
Restoration Amount, there shall be allocated to such Partner items of
Partnership income (including gross income) and gain in the amount of such
excess as quickly as possible, provided that an allocation pursuant to this
Section 10.06(c) shall be made only if and to the extent that the deficit in
such Partner's Capital Account would exceed such Partner's Restoration Amount
after all allocations provided for in this Article X have been made tentatively
as if Section 10.06(b) hereof and this Section 10.06(c) were not included in
this Agreement.

         (d) To the extent that an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any
Partnership asset pursuant to Section 743(b) of the Code is required, pursuant
to Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account
in determining Capital Accounts, the amount of such adjustment to the Capital
Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the
basis of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis) and

                                     - 28 -



<PAGE>






such gain or loss shall be specially allocated to the Partners in a manner
consistent with the manner in which their Capital Accounts are required to be
adjusted pursuant to such Section of the Treasury Regulations.

         (e) The allocations set forth in Sections 10.06(a), 10.06(b), 10.06(c)
and 10.06(d) hereof (the "REGULATORY ALLOCATIONS") are intended to comply with
certain requirements of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b). Notwithstanding
any other provisions of this Article X (other than the Regulatory Allocations),
the Regulatory Allocations shall be taken into account in allocating subsequent
Net Gain, Net Loss, Loss Items and items of income, gain, loss and deduction
among the Partners so that, to the extent possible, the net amount of such
allocations of subsequent Net Gain, Net Loss, Loss Items and other items and the
Regulatory Allocations to each Partner shall be equal to the net amount that
would have been allocated to each such Partner pursuant to the provisions of
this Article X if the Regulatory Allocations had not occurred.

             For purposes of applying the foregoing sentence, allocations
pursuant to this Section 10.06(e) shall be made with respect to allocations
pursuant to Section 10.06(d) only to the extent the Offshore General Partner
reasonably determines that such allocations will otherwise be inconsistent with
the economic agreement among the Partners. Further, if allocations to the
Domestic General Partner include or are affected by Regulatory Allocations or
allocations pursuant to this Section 10.06(e) intended to offset such Regulatory
Allocations, the Offshore General Partner, after consulting with the
Partnership's accountants and other advisors, shall have discretion to make such
adjustments to subsequent 20% Subordinate Gain Allocations as the Offshore
General Partner deems reasonably necessary or appropriate to effectuate the
economic arrangements of the Partners.

         (f) Subject only to the "QUALIFIED INCOME OFFSET" provisions of Section
10.06(b) hereof, the General Partners shall be allocated at least 1% of each
material item of Partnership income, gain, loss, deduction or credit at all
times during the existence of the Partnership. To the extent that any allocation
is made pursuant to this Section 10.06(f), such allocation shall be treated as a
Regulatory Allocation for purposes of Section 10.06(e); provided, however, that
in the event of any conflict between Section 10.06(e) and this Section 10.06(f),
this Section 10.06(f) shall govern.

         SECTION 10.07.  ADJUSTMENTS TO REFLECT CHANGES IN INTERESTS.

         (a) Notwithstanding the foregoing but subject to Section 10.07(b), with
respect to any fiscal period during which any Partner's interest in the
Partnership changes, whether by reason of the admission of a Partner, the
withdrawal of a Partner, a non-pro rata contribution of capital to the
Partnership or any other event described in Section 706(d)(1) of the Code and
regulations issued thereunder, allocations of Net Gain, Net Loss and Loss Items
shall be adjusted

                                     - 29 -



<PAGE>






appropriately to take into account the varying interests of the Partners during
such period. The Offshore General Partner shall consult with the Partnership's
accountants and other advisors and shall select the method of making such
adjustments, which method shall be used consistently thereafter.

         (b) If any Person is admitted to the Partnership (or the Subscription
of any existing Partner is increased) after the Initial Closing in accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement, the Offshore General Partner shall adjust
the allocations otherwise provided for in this Article X of Net Gain or Loss and
Loss Items (and items of Partnership income, gain, loss and expense), for the
fiscal year in which such event occurs and for subsequent fiscal years if
necessary, so that, after such adjustments have been made, each Partner
(including any Partners admitted after the Initial Closing and all Partners
whose Subscriptions have been increased after the Initial Closing) shall have
been allocated Partnership expenses, including Organizational Expenses, equal in
amount to the aggregate amount of Partnership expenses such Partner would have
been allocated if it had been admitted to the Partnership on the Initial Closing
with a Subscription equal to that set forth in Schedule A after such schedule
has been amended to reflect such Partner's admission or the increase in its
Subscription; provided, however, that (1) no item of income, gain or deductible
loss realized (or deemed to have been realized on a distribution in kind) before
the admission of any new Partner shall be allocated to such Partner and (2)
allocations to any existing Partner of items of income, gain or deductible loss
realized (or deemed to have been realized on a distribution in kind) prior to
the increase in the Subscription of such Partner shall be limited to those
permitted by Section 706 of the Code.

         SECTION 10.08. TAX ALLOCATIONS. For federal, state and local income tax
purposes, Partnership income, gain, loss, deduction or credit (or any item
thereof) for each fiscal year shall be allocated to and among the Partners in
order to reflect the allocations made pursuant to the provisions of this Article
X for such fiscal year (other than allocations of items which are not deductible
or are excluded from taxable income), taking into account any variation between
the adjusted tax basis and book value of Partnership property in accordance with
the principles of Section 704(c) of the Code.

         SECTION 10.09.  TIMING OF ALLOCATIONS.

         (a) The Offshore General Partner shall cause the Partnership to make
the allocations described in this Article X as of any time that the Partnership
enters an 8% Payback Period on the basis of an interim closing of the
Partnership's books at such time. It is intended that this Section 10.09, in
conjunction with Section 11.04(a) and the definition of 8% Preferential Return
Allocation set forth in Appendix A, shall be interpreted so as to apportion Net
Gain of the Partnership for the full fiscal period to be divided by such interim
closing to the short fiscal

                                     - 30 -



<PAGE>






period prior to the interim closing only to the extent necessary to provide each
Partner with the allocations of Net Gain contemplated by Sections 10.02(a) and
10.02(b), and that all remaining Net Gain for such full fiscal period shall be
deemed to be attributable to the short fiscal period following such interim
closing.

         (b) The Offshore General Partner in its sole discretion may also cause
the Partnership to make such allocations on the basis of an interim closing of
the books as of the time that any distribution is made during a fiscal period
that is not an 8% Payback Period. In such event, it is intended that the
pertinent provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted so as to apportion
Net Gain of the Partnership for the full fiscal period to be divided by such
interim closing to the short fiscal period prior to the interim closing and the
short fiscal period following such interim closing in the manner determined by
the Offshore General Partner, after consultation with the Partnership's
accountants and other advisors, to be appropriate to effectuate the economic
arrangements among the Partners as contemplated by this Agreement.

         (c) If any such interim closing  occurs,  each short fiscal period that
results shall constitute a fiscal year for purposes of this Article X other than
 Section 10.08 hereof. Tax allocations pursuant to Section 10.08 shall be made
only as of the end of each fiscal year.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                                  DISTRIBUTIONS

         SECTION 11.01.  TAX DISTRIBUTIONS.

         (a) The Partnership shall distribute to each Partner (including any
tax-exempt Partners) in cash, with respect to each fiscal year, either during
such year or within 90 days thereafter, an amount equal to the aggregate state
and federal income tax liability such Partner would have incurred as a result of
such Partner's ownership of an interest in the Partnership, calculated (i) as if
such Partner were (A) subject to tax as a resident or domiciliary of New York
City, New York and (B) taxable at the maximum rates provided for with respect to
natural persons (or, if higher, with respect to taxable corporations) under
applicable federal, state and local income tax laws as determined from time to
time by the Offshore General Partner after consulting with accountants to the
Partnership; (ii) as if allocations from the Partnership were, for such year,
the sole source of income and loss for such Partner; and (iii) without regard to
the carryover of items of loss, deduction and expense previously allocated by
the Partnership to such Partner (such distributions being referred to herein as
"TAX DISTRIBUTIONS").

         (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing: (1) the aggregate amount of Tax
Distributions that otherwise would be made pursuant to this Section 11.01 may be
reduced or not made with

                                     - 31 -



<PAGE>






respect to any fiscal year to the extent determined by the Offshore General
Partner in its sole discretion, and (2) Tax Distributions that otherwise would
be made to any Partner with respect to any Fiscal Year pursuant to Section
11.01(a) shall be reduced by the amount of any other cash distributions made by
the Partnership to such Partner during such Fiscal Year or within 90 days
thereafter, provided, however, that for purposes of this clause (2) any Tax
Distribution made within 90 days after the beginning of any fiscal year with
respect to a prior year shall not be accounted for as a Tax Distribution for the
fiscal year in which it was made.

         (c) The Partnership may make Tax Distributions to the Partners during
any Partnership fiscal year to enable them to satisfy their liability to make
estimated tax payments with respect to such fiscal year or the preceding fiscal
year based on calculations of the Partners' estimated tax liability made
pursuant to Section 11.01(a) as of such dates as the Offshore General Partner in
its sole discretion may determine; provided, however, that:

                  (1)
                  if the aggregate amount of Tax Distributions made to any
                  General Partner with respect to any fiscal year exceeds the
                  tax liability of such General Partner with respect to such
                  fiscal year (calculated as of the end of such fiscal year
                  pursuant to Section 11.01(a)), such excess shall be treated to
                  the maximum extent possible as an advance to such General
                  Partner against such General Partner's distributive share of
                  Partnership income and such General Partner shall return such
                  excess to the Partnership without interest promptly after the
                  determination of such excess amount; and

                  (2)
                  the Capital Account of a General Partner shall not be reduced
                  by any advances made to such General Partner pursuant to this
                  Section 11.01(c) during any fiscal year, but shall be reduced
                  as of the end of such fiscal year by an amount equal to the
                  aggregate amount of all such advances (net of any part of such
                  advances returned to the Partnership by such General Partner
                  pursuant to the preceding clause (1)).

         SECTION 11.02. TIMING OF DISTRIBUTIONS. The Partnership shall
distribute (a) the cash proceeds of all dispositions of Portfolio Securities and
(b) all other current income, in each case net of Partnership expenses and
reserves for reasonably-estimated future expenses and liabilities at such times
as the Offshore General Partner shall determine in its sole discretion and in
any case not later than 60 days after receipt of such cash proceeds or other
current income. The Partners acknowledge that it is the General Partners'
intention to make all distributions in cash during the term of the Partnership
except when the General Partners have determined in good

                                     - 32 -



<PAGE>






faith that a distribution of Portfolio Securities in kind, made in accordance
with the provisions of this Article XI, would yield greater value to the Limited
Partner at the time of distribution than a sale of such Portfolio Securities by
the Partnership and a subsequent distribution of the proceeds thereof to the
Limited Partner in cash.

         SECTION 11.03.  PRIORITY OF DISTRIBUTIONS.

         (a) Distributions of cash and Partnership property in kind (other than
Tax Distributions and Liquidating Distributions) made at any time while the
Partnership is not in an 8% Payback Period shall be made 100% to all Partners as
follows:

                  (1)
                  First, in proportion to their respective Contributions
                  Accounts until each Partner has received aggregate
                  distributions, in cash or in kind, equal to the balance in
                  such Partner's Contributions Account; and

                  (2)
                  Thereafter, in proportion to their respective 8% Distribution
                  Preferences.

         (b) Distributions of cash and Partnership property in kind (other than
Tax Distributions and Liquidating Distributions) made at any time while the
Partnership is in an 8% Payback Period shall be made in the following order and
priority:


         (1)
         First, 100% to the Domestic General Partner until the Domestic General
         Partner has received additional distributions equal to 20% of the sum
         of (i) the excess of the Partnership's aggregate prior distributions
         (including distributions made pursuant to Section 11.03(a) on the date
         that the amount of a distribution to be made pursuant to this Section
         11.03(b)(1) is being determined) over the aggregate balances in the
         Contributions Accounts of all Partners and (ii) the amount determined
         pursuant to the preceding clause (i) multiplied by 25% (20/80); and


         (2)
         Second, as long as the Partnership continues to be in an 8% Payback
         Period, 80% to all Partners in proportion to their respective
         Contributions Accounts and 20% to the Domestic General Partner.

         SECTION 11.04.  OPERATIONAL RULES.

                                     - 33 -



<PAGE>






         (a) If a proposed distribution of cash or of Partnership property in
kind made in accordance with the percentages specified in Section 11.03(a) would
cause the Partnership to enter an 8% Payback Period, such cash or property shall
be deemed to be divided into two parts, a "PRE-8% PAYBACK DISTRIBUTION"
consisting of that amount of such distribution which would cause the Partnership
to enter an 8% Payback Period if distributed in accordance with Section 11.03(a)
and a "POST-8% PAYBACK DISTRIBUTION" consisting of the balance of such
distribution; the Partnership's actual distribution of such property shall be
apportioned among the Partners accordingly.

         (b) Proposed distributions pursuant to Section 11.03(b) that would
cause aggregate distributions to the Domestic General Partner to exceed the
amounts described in Section 11.03(b)(1) shall be divided in a manner similar to
that provided for under Section 11.04(a).

         (c) Liquidating Distributions that cause the Partnership to enter into
an 8% Payback Period shall be deemed to be divided in a manner similar to that
provided for under Section 11.04(a) for purposes of Section 10.09 and any other
pertinent provision of this Agreement.

         (d) All distributions other than Liquidating Distributions shall be
made in cash or in Freely Tradeable Securities unless otherwise approved by the
Advisory Committee. The valuation of securities distributed in kind shall be
made in the manner provided in Article XII. Each class of securities to be
distributed in kind shall be distributed to the Partners in proportion to their
respective shares of the proposed distribution as provided in Section 11.03,
except to the extent that a disproportionate distribution of such securities is
necessary in order to avoid distributing fractional shares. For purposes of the
preceding sentence, each lot of stock or other securities having a separately
identifiable tax basis or holding period shall be treated as a separate class of
securities.

         SECTION 11.05. TAX WITHHOLDING. If the Partnership incurs a tax
withholding obligation with respect to any Partner, any amount required to be
withheld by the Partnership with respect to such Partner shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as if it had been transferred to such Partner by
the Partnership as an interest-free advance. Amounts treated as advanced to any
Partner pursuant to this Section 11.05 shall be repaid by such Partner to the
Partnership within 30 days after the Partnership delivers a written request to
such Partner for such repayment; provided, however, that if any such repayment
is not made, the Partnership, at the discretion of the Offshore General Partner,
shall (a) collect such unpaid amounts from any Partnership distributions that
otherwise would be made to such Partner and/or (b) subtract from the Capital
Account of such Partner, no later than the day prior to the Partnership's first

                                     - 34 -



<PAGE>






liquidating distribution, the amount of any such tax withholding not so
collected, in each case treating the amount so collected or subtracted as having
been distributed to such Partner at the time of such collection or subtraction.
For purposes of this Section 11.05, any tax withholding obligation incurred by
any General Partner with respect to any Partner shall constitute a Partnership
obligation.

         SECTION 11.06. DISTRIBUTIONS ON ACCEPTANCE OF ADDITIONAL SUBSCRIPTIONS.
Upon the increase in the Subscription of any existing Partner pursuant to
Section 7.01, the Offshore General Partner may, but shall not be obligated, to
cause the Partnership to distribute prior to such increase to the Persons who
were Partners prior to such increase in aggregate Subscriptions and in
proportion to such Partners' respective Contributions Accounts as of the time
immediately prior to such increase in Subscriptions, part or all of any amounts
earned by the Partnership on such Partners' paid-in capital contributions before
such contributions were invested in Portfolio Securities.

         SECTION 11.07. CERTAIN DISTRIBUTIONS PROHIBITED. Anything in this
Article XI to the contrary notwithstanding, all Partnership distributions shall
be subject to the following limitations.

         (a) No distribution shall be made to any Partner if, and to the extent
that, such distribution would not be permitted under any applicable provision of
Bermuda law.

         (b) No distribution other than a Tax Distribution shall be made to any
Partner to the extent that such distribution, if made, would cause the deficit
balance, if any, in the Capital Account of such Partner (determined without
regard to any allocations made pursuant to Section 10.06(b) and 10.06(c)) to
exceed such Partner's Restoration Amount.

         SECTION 11.08. CONSENT TO DISTRIBUTIONS. Each Partner, by becoming a
Partner, consents to any such distribution hereafter made or omitted to be made
to the Partners or any of them in accordance with this Article XI.

                                   ARTICLE XII

                         VALUATION OF PARTNERSHIP ASSETS

         SECTION 12.01. VALUATION BY DOMESTIC GENERAL PARTNER. Whenever
valuation of Partnership assets or net assets is required by this Agreement, the
Domestic General Partner shall determine the fair market value thereof in good
faith in accordance with this Article XII. In the event of a distribution of
securities which are not Freely Tradeable Securities, the Domestic

                                     - 35 -



<PAGE>






General Partner shall also consult with the Advisory Committee with respect to
the determination of the fair market value of such securities.

         SECTION 12.02. FAIR MARKET VALUE. The fair market value of any security
owned by the Partnership which is a Freely Tradeable Security (as defined in
Section 12.03) shall be determined as of the close of trading on the date as of
which the value is being determined by taking the last reported trade price of
such security on such trading date on the exchange where it is primarily traded
or, if such security is not traded on an exchange, such security shall be valued
at the last reported sale price on such date on the Nasdaq National Market
maintained by the United States National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
or, if such security is not reported on the Nasdaq National Market, such
security shall be valued at the reported closing bid price (or average of bid
prices) last quoted on such date as reported by an established quotation service
for over-the-counter securities. The determination of the fair market value of
all other assets of the Partnership shall be based upon all relevant factors,
including, without limitation, such of the following factors as may be deemed
relevant by the Domestic General Partner: current financial position and current
and historic operating results of the issuer; sales prices of recent public or
private transactions in the same or similar securities, including transactions
on any securities exchange on which such securities are listed or in the
over-the-counter market; general level of interest rates; recent trading volume
of the security and other considerations affecting market liquidity;
restrictions on transfer, including the Partnership's right, if any, to require
registration of its securities by the issuer under the securities laws;
significant recent events affecting the issuer, including any pending private
placement, public offering, merger or acquisition; the price paid by the
Partnership to acquire the asset; the percentage of the issuer's outstanding
securities that is owned by the Partnership; and all other factors affecting
value.

         In making any such determination of the fair market value of the assets
of the Partnership, no allowance of any kind shall be made for goodwill or the
name of the Partnership or of either General Partner, the Partnership's office
records, files and statistical data or any intangible assets of the Partnership.

         SECTION 12.03. FREELY TRADEABLE SECURITIES. For purposes of this
Agreement a security shall be deemed to be a "FREELY TRADEABLE SECURITY" if (a)
the Partnership's entire holding of such securities can be sold by the
Partnership to the general public (including a sale by any Partner of the entire
distributed amount of its holdings following a distribution of such security
from the Partnership even though a sale by the Partnership of such securities,
if not so distributed to the Partners but sold by the Partnership to the general
public, might otherwise be restricted by volume limitations) and such sale can
be effected pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act or otherwise without the
necessity of any United States federal, state or local government registration
or consent (other than any ministerial notice filings of the type required

                                     - 36 -



<PAGE>






pursuant to Rule 144(h)), and (b) such securities are traded in a Public
Securities Market and market quotations are available for such securities,
including quotations available from market makers or specialists. If only a
portion of the Partnership's holdings of a class of securities satisfies the
requirements of the preceding sentence, that portion of such class shall
constitute Freely Tradeable Securities (so that, for example, any Partner can
sell the entire distributed amount of its holdings in such security following a
distribution of such security from the Partnership).

         SECTION 12.04. GOODWILL. The Partnership's name and goodwill shall, as
among the Partners, be deemed to have no value and shall belong to the
Partnership, and no Partner shall have any right or claim individually to the
use thereof. Upon termination of the Partnership, the right to the trade name of
the Partnership and any goodwill associated with the Partnership's name shall be
assigned to the Domestic General Partner.

                                  ARTICLE XIII

                           DURATION OF THE PARTNERSHIP

         SECTION 13.01. TERM OF PARTNERSHIP. The Partnership shall continue
until the date that is eight years after the Initial Closing unless its term is
extended as provided in Section 13.04, or unless it is sooner dissolved as
provided in Sections 13.02 or 13.03 or by operation of law.

         SECTION 13.02. DISSOLUTION UPON WITHDRAWAL OF GENERAL PARTNERS. The
Partnership shall be dissolved 90 days after the occurrence with respect to
either of the General Partners of any of the following events unless the Limited
Partner, at the direction of all of the Shareholders, agrees within such 90-day
period to continue the Partnership and appoint, effective as of the date of
withdrawal, a new General Partner:


         (1)
         such General Partner (A) makes an assignment for the benefit of
         creditors, (B) files a voluntary petition in bankruptcy, (C) is
         adjudged bankrupt or insolvent, or has entered against it an order for
         relief in any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding, (D) files a petition
         or answer seeking for itself any reorganization, arrangement,
         composition, readjustment, liquidation, dissolution, or similar relief
         under any statute, law, or regulation, (E) files an answer or other
         pleading admitting or failing to contest the material allegations of a
         petition filed against it in any proceeding of this nature, or (F)
         seeks, consents to, or acquiesces in, the appointment of a trustee,
         receiver, or liquidator of itself or of all or any substantial part of
         its properties;

                                     - 37 -



<PAGE>







         (2)
         when 90 days have elapsed after the commencement of any proceeding
         against such General Partner seeking reorganization, arrangement,
         composition, readjustment, liquidation, dissolution, or similar relief
         under any statute, law, or regulation, if the proceeding has not been
         dismissed before that date;


         (3)
         when 90 days have elapsed after the appointment without its consent or
         acquiescence of a trustee, receiver, or liquidator of such General
         Partner or of all or any substantial part of its properties and the
         appointment is not vacated or stayed, or when 90 days have elapsed
         after the expiration of any such stay, if the appointment is not
         vacated before that date; or


         (4)
         when an involuntary certificate of dissolution or its equivalent is
         filed for such General Partner or its dissolution is effected (if such
         General Partner is a corporation) or when such General Partner is
         dissolved and its affairs wound up (if such General Partner is a
         partnership).

         SECTION 13.03. DISSOLUTION BY PARTNERS. (a) The Offshore General
Partner, with the consent of the Limited Partner, may dissolve the Partnership
at any time on not less than 60 days' prior written notice of such dissolution
to the Domestic General Partner and the Shareholders; provided that the Domestic
General Partner, with the consent of at least 50% in interest of the limited
partners of the Domestic Partnership, simultaneously dissolves the Domestic
Partnership.

   
         (b) The Limited Partner,  as directed by vote of two-thirds in interest
of the  Shareholders  of the  Limited  Partner  taken  within 45 days  after the
occurrence of any event giving rise to such right,  may dissolve the Partnership
(provided that the limited partners of the Domestic  Partnership  simultaneously
dissolve the Domestic  Partnership) if: (i) a General Partner commits a material
breach of any of its material  obligations  under this Agreement and such breach
continues to exist for 60 days after delivery of notice to such General  Partner
of the occurrence of such breach or after such General  Partner becomes aware of
such breach;  or (ii) a General  Partner,  any partner of a General Partner or a
member of the Domestic General Partner's general partner is charged or convicted
of a felony in connection with the business of the Partnership.
    

   
         SECTION 13.04. EXTENSION OF TERM. It is contemplated by the Partners
that the term of the Partnership shall terminate on the date that is eight years
after the Initial Closing and that

                                     - 38 -



<PAGE>







the Partnership shall be considered to be dissolved on such date without any
further action being required by any of the Partners, unless sooner terminated
pursuant to Sections 13.02 or 13.03 or by operation of law. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the term of the Partnership may be extended for two additional
one-year periods by the Offshore General Partner with the prior approval of the
Advisory Committee. The Offshore General Partner shall notify the Limited
Partner promptly of any such extension.
    

                                   ARTICLE XIV

                      LIQUIDATION OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS

         SECTION 14.01. GENERAL PROVISIONS. At dissolution, the Partnership's
assets shall be liquidated in an orderly manner. The General Partners shall be
the liquidators to wind up the affairs of the Partnership pursuant to this
Agreement; provided that, if there shall be no remaining General Partner at that
time, the Limited Partner may designate one or more other Persons to act as the
liquidator(s) instead of the General Partners.

         SECTION 14.02. LIQUIDATING DISTRIBUTIONS. The liquidator(s) shall pay
or provide for the satisfaction of the Partnership's liabilities and obligations
to creditors. Any Net Gain or Loss realized in connection with the liquidation
of the Partnership shall be allocated among the Partners pursuant to Article X,
and the remaining assets of the Partnership shall then be distributed to the
Partners in cash (to the extent feasible) in proportion to the positive balances
in the respective Capital Accounts of the Partners (and, if a distribution in
kind is necessary, after allocating any Net Gain or Loss attributable to such
distribution). In performing their duties, the liquidator(s) are authorized to
sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of the assets of the Partnership in such
reasonable manner as the liquidator(s) shall determine to be in the best
interest of the Partners. During the liquidation of the Partnership, the
liquidator(s) shall furnish to the Partners the financial statements and other
information specified in Article XIX.

         SECTION 14.03. EXPENSES OF LIQUIDATOR(S). The reasonable expenses
incurred by the liquidator(s) in connection with winding up the Partnership, all
other losses or liabilities of the Partnership incurred in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, and reasonable compensation for the services of the
liquidator(s) (which, with respect to any liquidator who is a General Partner,
shall be paid only if the Management Agreement is no longer in effect, and in
that event shall be in an amount determined in accordance with Section 3.06)
shall be borne by the Partnership. Subject to the terms of the Management
Agreement, and provided such agreement shall not have been terminated, and
provided further, that the Limited Partner has not designated another liquidator
pursuant to Section 14.01, the Management Fee shall be continued for a period of
one year from the date of dissolution or until the liquidation is completed,
whichever is sooner, to permit the Management Company to assist in the
liquidation.

                                     - 39 -



<PAGE>






         SECTION 14.04. DURATION OF LIQUIDATION. A reasonable time shall be
allowed for the winding up of the affairs of the Partnership in order to
minimize any losses otherwise attendant upon such a winding up. The
liquidator(s) shall use its best efforts to dispose of or distribute all
Partnership assets within one year of dissolution, but shall not be bound to do
so or liable in any way to any Partner for failure to do so. The liquidator(s)
shall then make final liquidating distributions from the Partnership before the
later of (i) the end of the taxable year in which the date of liquidation of the
Partnership occurs, or (ii) 90 days after the date of the liquidation of the
Partnership. For this purpose, (x) the date of the liquidation of the
Partnership shall be the date on which the Partnership has ceased to be a going
concern, and (y) the Partnership shall not be deemed to have ceased to be a
going concern until it has sold, distributed or otherwise disposed of its
Portfolio Securities.

         SECTION 14.05. DUTY OF CARE. The liquidator(s) shall not be liable to
the Partnership or any Partner for any loss attributable to any act or omission
of the liquidator(s) taken in good faith in connection with the liquidation of
the Partnership and distribution of its assets in the belief that such course of
conduct was in the best interest of the Partnership. The liquidator(s) may
consult with counsel, accountants, investment bankers and appraisers with
respect to liquidating the Partnership and distributing its assets and shall be
justified in acting or omitting to act in accordance with the advice or opinion
of such counsel, accountants, investment bankers and appraisers provided they
shall have been selected and retained with reasonable care.

         SECTION 14.06. NO LIABILITY FOR RETURN OF CAPITAL. The liquidator(s),
the General Partners and their respective officers, directors, agents, partners
(including the officers, directors, employees, members, managers and agents of
the partners of the General Partner) and their Affiliates shall not be
personally liable for the return of the capital contributions of any Partner to
the Partnership. No Partner shall be obligated to restore to the Partnership any
amount with respect to a negative Capital Account; provided, however, that this
provision shall not affect the obligations of Partners to make their agreed upon
capital contributions to the Partnership.

         SECTION 14.07 DOMESTIC GENERAL PARTNER'S OBLIGATION TO RESTORE DEFICIT.
Upon completion of the liquidation of the Partnership, the Domestic General
Partner shall repay to the Partnership an amount equal to the deficit (if any)
in the Capital Account of the Domestic General Partner; provided, however, that
the total amount which the Domestic General Partner shall be obligated to return
to the Partnership pursuant to this Section 14.07 shall not exceed the aggregate
amount of distributions received by the Domestic General Partner from the
Partnership reduced by the sum of (i) the aggregate amount of distributions that
the Domestic General Partner would have received if each Partnership
distribution had been made to all Partners in proportion to the balances in
their respective Contributions Accounts, and (ii) the aggregate amount of Tax
Distributions made to the Domestic General Partner as of the date of

                                     - 40 -



<PAGE>






determination (to the extent not taken into account under the proceeding clause
(i)). The Domestic General Partner shall satisfy its repayment obligation by
delivering to the Partnership either cash or securities previously distributed
to the Domestic General Partner by the Partnership, valued in accordance with
Article XII as of the date such repayment is made. Any such repayment shall be
made before the later of (1) the end of the taxable year in which the date of
liquidation of the Partnership occurs, or (2) 90 days after the date of the
liquidation of the Partnership. For this purpose, (A) the date of the
liquidation of the Partnership shall be the date on which the Partnership has
ceased to be a going concern, and (B) the Partnership shall not be deemed to
have ceased to be a going concern until it has sold, distributed or otherwise
disposed of its Portfolio Securities. The intent of this Section 14.07, in
conjunction with the definition of "Restoration Amount," is to require the
Domestic General Partner to return to the Partnership any distributions (other
than Tax Distributions) made to the Domestic General Partner with respect to its
20% "carried interest" to the extent that such distributions exceed in the
aggregate 20% of the excess of the Net Gain of the Partnership from its
inception through and including the date of the Partnership's final liquidating
distribution over the Net Loss of the Partnership over that period, and these
provisions shall be interpreted and applied accordingly. Amounts returned by the
Domestic General Partner to the Partnership shall be paid to creditors of the
Partnership (provided that no creditor of the Partnership shall have the right
to enforce any obligation of the Domestic General Partner to make the repayments
contemplated by this Section 14.07) or distributed to the Limited Partner.

                                   ARTICLE XV

             LIMITATION ON TRANSFERS OF INTERESTS OF LIMITED PARTNER

         SECTION 15.01. Limitation on Transfers of Interests of Limited Partner.
The Limited Partner shall not assign, pledge, mortgage, hypothecate, sell or
otherwise dispose of or encumber all or any part of its limited partnership
interest. Any attempted transfer of the Limited Partner's interest shall be
void. The foregoing limitation shall not restrict any Shareholder of the Limited
Partner from transferring all or any part of its interest in the Limited
Partner, and the Bye-laws of the Limited Partner shall govern any such
transfers.

                                   ARTICLE XVI

                       WITHDRAWAL OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS

         SECTION 16.01. WITHDRAWAL OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS. No Partner shall
have the right to withdraw its capital and profits from the Partnership.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Partners may effect a partial
withdrawal of the Limited Partner's interest in the Partnership in order to
accommodate certain redemptions of the Limited Partner's Preference

                                     - 41 -



<PAGE>






Shares pursuant to the Limited Partner's bye-laws. As promptly as practicable
following such partial withdrawal, there shall be distributed to the Limited
Partner, in full payment and satisfaction of such portion of such interest in
the Partnership, an amount equal to the amount which such Limited Partner would
have been entitled to receive with respect to such interest pursuant to Article
XIV if the Partnership had been liquidated on and as of the date of such partial
withdrawal and all of the Partnership's assets had been sold on such date for
their fair market value. No approval of the Partners shall be required prior to
the making of such distribution. For purposes of determining the amount of the
distribution to be made to the Limited Partner, and the value of each of the
Partnership's assets, the Partnership's annual or quarterly financial
statements, as the case may be, prepared in accordance with Article XIX hereof
for the period ending on the date of such partial withdrawal shall be deemed to
be conclusive. Such distribution shall be payable in cash, cash equivalents
and/or securities of Portfolio Companies, with each separate group of cash, cash
equivalents, securities of Portfolio Companies and/or other assets (determined
in a manner consistent with the last sentence of Section 11.04(d)) being
distributed to the Limited Partner with respect to such interest in proportion
to the Limited Partner's interest in the Partnership as a whole to the extent
practicable.

                                             ARTICLE XVII

            LIMITATION ON TRANSFERS OF INTERESTS OF GENERAL PARTNERS

         SECTION 17.01. LIMITATION ON TRANSFERS OF INTERESTS OF GENERAL
PARTNERS. No General Partner shall assign, pledge, mortgage, hypothecate, sell
or otherwise dispose of or encumber all or any part of its general partnership
interest. Any attempted transfer of a General Partner's interest shall be void.

                                  ARTICLE XVIII

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

         SECTION 18.01. GENERAL PROVISIONS. Each General Partner, its partners,
officers, directors, employees, members, managers and agents (including the
officers, directors, employees, members, managers, consultants and agents of
each partner of the Domestic General Partner), each director, officer, employee,
consultant and agent of the Management Company, and each member of the Advisory
Committee (herein referred to as an "INDEMNITEE") shall be indemnified by the
Partnership (only out of Partnership assets, including the proceeds of liability
insurance) against any claim, demand, controversy, dispute, cost, loss, damage,
expense (including attorneys' fees), judgment and/or liability incurred by or
imposed upon the Indemnitee in connection with any action, suit or proceeding
(including any proceeding before any administrative or legislative body or
agency) to which the Indemnitee may be a party or

                                     - 42 -



<PAGE>






otherwise involved, or with which the Indemnitee may be threatened, by reason of
the Indemnitee's (or the Indemnitee's employee) being at the time the cause of
action arose or thereafter, a General Partner (including the Domestic General
Partner acting as Tax Matters Partner), a partner thereof (including the
officers, directors, employees, managers, members, consultants and agents of
each partner of the Domestic General Partner), an officer, director, employee,
consultant, member, manager or other agent of any General Partner, a director,
officer, employee, consultant or other agent of the Offshore General Partner or
of the Management Company or a member of the Advisory Committee, or a director,
officer, partner, employee, consultant, member, manager or other agent of any
other organization in which the Partnership owns an interest or of which the
Partnership is a creditor, which other organization the Indemnitee (or its
employee) serves or has served as a director, officer, partner, employee,
consultant, member, manager or other agent at the request of the Partnership
(whether or not the Indemnitee or its employee continues to serve in such
capacity at the time such action, suit or proceeding is brought or threatened),
except with respect to matters as to which the Indemnitee (or its employee)
shall have been finally adjudicated in any such action, suit or proceeding (i)
not to have acted in good faith and in the belief that the Indemnitee's (or
employee's) action was in accordance with such Person's obligations to the
Partnership, (ii) to have acted with gross negligence or a willful disregard of
his duties or (iii) with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have
had cause to believe beyond any reasonable doubt the Indemnitee's (or
employee's) conduct was criminal. In the event of settlement of any action, suit
or proceeding brought or threatened, such indemnification shall apply to all
matters covered by the settlement. The foregoing right of indemnification shall
be in addition to any rights to which any Indemnitee may otherwise be entitled
and shall inure to the benefit of the executors, administrators, personal
representatives, successors or assigns of each such Indemnitee.

         SECTION 18.02. ADVANCE PAYMENT OF EXPENSES. The Partnership shall pay
the expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in defending a civil or criminal action,
suit or proceeding, or in opposing any claim arising in connection with any
potential or threatened civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding, in advance
of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding, upon receipt of an
undertaking by such Indemnitee to repay such payment if he shall be determined
to be not entitled to indemnification therefor as provided herein; provided,
however, that in such instance the Indemnitee is not commencing an action, suit,
or proceeding against the Partnership, or defending an action, suit or
proceeding commenced against him by the Partnership or opposing a claim by the
Partnership arising in connection with any such potential or threatened action,
suit or proceeding.

         SECTION 18.03. INSURANCE. The Offshore General Partner, on behalf of
the Partnership, may cause the Partnership to purchase and maintain insurance
with such limits or coverages as the Offshore General Partner reasonably deems
appropriate, at the expense of the

                                     - 43 -



<PAGE>






Partnership and to the extent available, for the protection of any Indemnitee
against any liability incurred by such Indemnitee in any such capacity or
arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Partnership has the power
to indemnify such Indemnitee against such liability. The Offshore General
Partner may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of the Partnership for the
protection of any officer, director, employee, consultant or other agent of any
other organization in which the Partnership owns an interest or of which the
Partnership is a creditor against similar liabilities, whether or not the
Partnership has the power to indemnify him or it against such liabilities.

         SECTION 18.04. SHARING OF INDEMNIFICATION EXPENSES WITH RELATED FUNDS.
It is understood and agreed that, with regard to any claim for indemnification
pursuant to this Article XVIII which relates to a common activity of the
Partnership and the Domestic Partnership, or any Successor Entity, the
Partnership shall be obligated to provide indemnity hereunder up to, but only to
the extent of, its pro rata share of the total of any such amounts so paid by
any or all of the Partnership, the Domestic Partnership, or any Successor Entity
(i) if such claim arises from a Portfolio Company investment, in proportion to
the respective amounts invested by the Partnership and such other funds in such
Portfolio Company, and (ii) otherwise in proportion to the respective amounts of
capital contributed (in cash and commitments) to the respective partnerships or
related funds.

         SECTION 18.05. LIMITATION BY LAW. If any General Partner or the
Partnership is subject to any Bermuda or United States federal or state law,
rule or regulation which restricts the extent to which any person may be
exonerated or indemnified by the Partnership in any particular instance, then
the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article XVIII and the
exoneration provisions set forth in Sections 3.10 and 14.05 shall be deemed to
be amended, automatically and without further action by the General Partners or
the Limited Partner, to conform to such restrictions on exoneration or
indemnification as set forth in such applicable Bermuda or United States federal
or state law, rule or regulation. If any such law, statute, rule or regulation
of any jurisdiction by which the Partnership may be governed, including Bermuda
and the United States, is thereafter amended to enlarge the scope of
indemnification or eliminate or reduce the liability of any Indemnitee, then
this Agreement shall be deemed to be amended, automatically and without any
further action by the General Partners or the Limited Partner to broaden
correspondingly the exoneration or indemnification provided hereunder; provided,
however, that the scope of the exoneration or indemnification provided hereunder
shall not be enlarged beyond that which is set forth in this Article XVIII as of
the date hereof. The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses
conferred in this Article XVIII shall not be exclusive of any other right which
any Indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under any law, statute, rule,
regulation, charter document, by-law, contract or agreement.

designee thereof) during normal business hours may examine, or request that the
Offshore General Partner furnish, such additional information as is reasonably
necessary to enable the Limited Partner (or the designee thereof) to review the
state of the investment activities of the Partnership. Notwithstanding the

in advance of the time and place of the year's annual meeting. At the Offshore
General Partner's discretion, the annual meeting for a particular year may be
held in several locations at different times to make attendance more convenient
for the Shareholders of the Limited Partners. At the Offshore General Partner's
discretion, individual meetings with interested Shareholders of the Limited
Partner may be held in lieu of, or in addition to, an annual meeting.

period to the extent permitted by Section 709 of the Code.

may be; provided, however, that the principal office of the Partnership shall be

                                   ARTICLE XX

                              WAIVER AND AMENDMENT

         SECTION 20.01.  WAIVER AND AMENDMENT.

         (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the terms and
provisions of this Agreement may be waived, modified, terminated or amended with
the written consent of the General Partners and the Limited Partner. No such
amendment shall, however, (1) dilute the relative interest of any Partner in the
profits or capital of the Partnership or in allocations or distributions
attributable to the ownership of such interest without the written consent of
such Partner (except such dilution as may result from additional Subscriptions
from the Limited Partner), or (2) increase the Subscription of any Partner
without the written consent of such Partner, or (3) alter or waive the terms of:
(A) Section 2.03 without the written consent of each Shareholder of the Limited
Partner; and (B) Section 4.02 and this Article XX without the written consent of
any Partner which would be adversely affected thereby. The Offshore General
Partner shall promptly furnish copies of any amendments to this Agreement to all
Partners. The admission or substitution of Partners and increases in
Subscriptions shall not require the consent of, or notice to, the Limited
Partner.

         (b) In addition to any amendments otherwise authorized hereby, this
Agreement may be amended from time to time by the General Partners without the
consent of the Limited Partner to cure any ambiguity or correct or supplement
any provisions hereof which may be inconsistent

                                     - 47 -



<PAGE>






with any other provision hereof, or correct any printing, stenographic or
clerical errors or omissions.

         (c) Except as otherwise specifically set forth in this Agreement, any
amendment, consent, waiver, modification or termination of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement which results in the same economic and legal
consequences to the Partners and the limited partners of the Domestic
Partnership shall require the written consent of the General Partners and the
general partner of the Domestic Partnership, and the written consent of the
Limited Partner and limited partners of the Domestic Partnership constituting,
in the aggregate, a majority in interest of the Limited Partner and all such
limited partners, voting together as a single class. In any vote under this
Agreement which includes the interest of the Limited Partner and the limited
partners of the Domestic Partnership, the Limited Partner's vote shall be
divided into separate votes in order to give effect to the differing votes of
the Limited Partner's Shareholders under the Limited Partner's bye-laws.

                                   ARTICLE XXI

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

         SECTION 21.01. NOTICES. Except where otherwise specifically provided in
this Agreement, all notices, requests, consents, approvals and statements shall
be in writing and shall be deemed to have been properly given by personal
delivery or if mailed from within the country of the sender by air mail or first
class mail, postage prepaid, or if sent by prepaid telegram, electronic
facsimile transmission or telex, or if sent by courier service, addressed in
each case, at its address set forth in Schedule A, or, in each case, to such
other address or addresses as the addressee may have specified by written notice
as aforesaid to the other parties. Notices delivered by air mail shall be deemed
to be received five days after the date of the mailing.

         SECTION 21.02.  POWER OF ATTORNEY.

         (a) Each of the undersigned by execution of this Agreement constitutes
and appoints each General Partner, acting singly, with full power to act without
the other, as its true and lawful representative and attorney-in-fact, in its
name, place and stead, to make, execute, sign, acknowledge and deliver or file
(1) all instruments, documents and certificates which may from time to time be
required by any law to effectuate, implement and continue the valid and
subsisting existence of the Partnership, (2) all instruments, documents and
certificates that may be required to effectuate the dissolution and termination
of the Partnership in accordance with the provisions hereof and Bermuda law, (3)
all other amendments of this Agreement or the Certificate contemplated by this
Agreement including, without limitation, amendments reflecting the return, in
whole or in part, of the contribution of any Partner, or the addition,
substitution or

                                     - 48 -



<PAGE>






increased contribution of any Partner, or any action of the Partners duly taken
pursuant to this Agreement whether or not such Partner voted in favor of or
otherwise approved such action, and (4) any other instrument, certificate or
document required from time to time to admit a Partner, to effect its
substitution as a Partner, to effect the substitution of the Partner's assignee
as a Partner, or to reflect any action of the Partners provided for in this
Agreement.

         (b) Each of the Partners is aware that the terms of this Agreement
permit certain amendments to this Agreement and the Certificate to be effected
and certain other actions to be taken by or with respect to the Partnership, in
each case with the approval or by the vote of less than all the Partners. If, as
and when (1) an amendment of this Agreement and the Certificate is proposed or
an action is proposed to be taken by or with respect to the Partnership which
does not require, under the terms of this Agreement, the approval of all of the
Partners, (2) Partners holding the interest in the Partnership specified in this
Agreement as being required for such amendment or action have approved such
amendment or action in the manner contemplated by this Agreement (disregarding
the consent of any Partner whose approval has been granted by any General
Partner's use of such Partner's power of attorney), and (3) a Partner has failed
or refused to approve such amendment or action (hereinafter referred to as a
non-consenting Partner), each non-consenting Partner agrees that the special
attorney specified above, with full power of substitution, is hereby authorized
and empowered to execute, acknowledge, make, swear to, verify, deliver, record,
file and/or publish, for and on behalf of such non-consenting Partner, and in
its name, place and stead, any and all instruments and documents which may be
necessary or appropriate to permit such amendment to be lawfully made or action
lawfully taken. Each Partner is fully aware that it and each other Partner has
executed this special power of attorney, and that each Partner will rely on the
effectiveness of such powers with a view to the orderly administration of the
Partnership's affairs.

         (c) The powers of attorney granted herein (1) shall be deemed to be
coupled with an interest, shall be irrevocable and shall survive the death,
insanity, incompetency, or incapacity (or, in the case of a Partner that is a
corporation, association, limited liability company, partnership or trust, shall
survive the merger, dissolution or other termination of existence) of the
Partner and (2) shall survive the assignment by the Partner of the whole or any
portion of his interest, except that where the assignee of the whole or any
portion thereof has furnished a power of attorney, this power of attorney shall
survive such assignment for the sole purpose of enabling any General Partner to
execute, acknowledge, and file any instrument necessary to effect any permitted
substitution of the assignee for the assignor as a Partner and shall thereafter
terminate. In the event that the appointment conferred in this Section 21.02
would not constitute a legal and valid appointment by any Partner under the laws
of the jurisdiction in which such Partner is incorporated, established or
resident, upon the request of the General Partners, such Partner shall deliver
to the General Partners a properly authenticated and duly executed document
constituting

                                     - 49 -



<PAGE>






a legal and valid power of attorney under the laws of the appropriate
jurisdiction covering the matters set forth in this Section 21.02. Each of the
General Partners shall have full and irrevocable power of attorney (with the
full right of substitution) to act on behalf of the Limited Partner or former
Limited Partner, and each General Partner shall have full and irrevocable power
of attorney (with the full right of substitution) to act on behalf of any other
General Partner, and the Limited Partner jointly shall have full and irrevocable
power of attorney (with the full right of substitution) to act on behalf of any
General Partner, to perform such acts as are necessary in order to perform or
complete the delivery of assets of the Partnership, in connection with the
transfer of any Partner's interest in the Partnership, in connection with the
admission of any Limited Partner to the Partnership or withdrawal of any Limited
Partner from the Partnership, or for any other reason.

         (d) The General Partners shall require a power of attorney to be
executed by a transferee of a Partner as a condition of its admission as a
substitute Partner.

         SECTION 21.03. WAIVER OF PARTITION. Each Partner hereby irrevocably
waives any and all rights that it may have to maintain an action for partition
of any of the Partnership's property.

         SECTION 21.04. ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS. Each Partner hereby agrees to
execute all certificates, counterparts, amendments, instruments or documents
that may be required by the laws of the various jurisdictions in which the
Partnership conducts its activities, to conform with the laws of such
jurisdictions governing limited partnerships.

         SECTION 21.05. BINDING ON SUCCESSORS. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and it shall inure to the benefit of the respective heirs, successors,
assigns and legal representatives of the parties hereto.

         SECTION 21.06. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement or any amendment hereto may
be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but
all of which taken together shall constitute one agreement (or amendment, as the
case may be).

         SECTION 21.07. VOTING. Any vote or other action required or permitted
to be taken by this Agreement may be taken by written consent signed by not less
than the requisite percentage in interest of parties required or permitted to
take such vote or other action.

         SECTION 21.08. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of Bermuda; provided, however, that the
nature and extent of the obligation of any member of the Advisory Committee to
Persons other than the

                                     - 50 -



<PAGE>






Partnership and any one or more Partners in their capacities as such shall be
determined under the laws of the jurisdiction or jurisdictions imposing such
obligations.

         SECTION 21.09. SECURITIES ACT MATTERS. Each Partner understands that in
addition to the restrictions on transfer contained in this Agreement, it must
bear the economic risks of its investment for an indefinite period because the
Partnership interests have not been registered under the Securities Act and,
therefore, may not be sold or otherwise transferred unless they are registered
under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available.
Each Partner agrees with all other Partners that it will not sell or otherwise
transfer its interest in the Partnership unless such interest has been so
registered or in the opinion of counsel for the Partnership, or of other counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Partnership, such an exemption is available.

         SECTION 21.10. RIGHT TO RELY ON AUTHORITY OF GENERAL PARTNERS. No
Person that is not a Partner, in dealing with any General Partner, shall be
required to determine such General Partner's authority to make any commitment or
engage in any undertaking on behalf of the Partnership, or to determine any fact
or circumstance bearing upon the existence of the authority of such General
Partner, subject to any restrictions as provided herein.

         SECTION 21.11. TAX MATTERS PARTNER. The "TAX MATTERS PARTNER," as
defined in Section 6231 of the Code, of the Partnership shall be the Domestic
General Partner (the "TAX MATTERS PARTNER"). The Tax Matters Partner shall not
resign as tax matters partner of the Partnership unless, on the effective date
of such resignation, the Partnership has designated another general partner as
Tax Matters Partner and that general partner has given its consent in writing to
its appointment as Tax Matters Partner. The Tax Matters Partner shall receive no
additional compensation from the Partnership for its services in that capacity,
but all expenses incurred by the Tax Matters Partner shall be borne by the
Partnership. The Tax Matters Partner is authorized to employ such accountants,
attorneys and agents as it, in its sole discretion, determines are necessary to
or useful in the performance of its duties. Any Person who serves as Tax Matters
Partner shall not be liable to the Partnership or to any Partner for any action
it takes or fails to take as Tax Matters Partner with respect to any
administrative or judicial proceeding involving "PARTNERSHIP ITEMS" (as defined
in Section 6231 of the Code) of the Partnership, unless such action or failure
to act constitutes a violation of a General Partner's duty of care set forth in
Section 3.10.

         SECTION 21.12. TITLE TO PARTNERSHIP ASSETS. Without prejudice to the
economic interests in the Partnership of the Limited Partner, the General

         immediately  prior to the date on which a date of  record  is taken for
         such vote,  or, if no record is taken,  the date as of which the record

         amount (the "REDEMPTION PRICE") equal to the Liquidation  Preference as
         of  the  effective  date  of  such   redemption  by  giving  notice  (a
         "REDEMPTION  NOTICE") to each  holder of Series A Preferred  Shares and

         Stock, Issuer will first obtain stockholder approval of the issuance to
         the extent then required by the rules and regulations of the NASD or of
         such other national  exchange upon which Issuer's  Common Stock is then
         traded. Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid,  dividends
         on the  Series A  Preferred  Shares  shall  cease to  accrue  as of the
         effective  date of such  redemption  unless the Issuer  defaults in the
         payment of the Redemption Price.

                  (4)  Conversion  of Series A  Preferred  Shares.  The Series A
         Preferred  Shares shall be  convertible  into shares of Common Stock on

         convertible  at any time into a number of fully paid and  nonassessable

         Conversion Price (the "Conversion Ratio").
 
                            (b) Mandatory  Conversion  The outstanding  Series A
         Preferred  Shares will be deemed to have been  converted into shares of
         Common Stock at the  Conversion  Ratio  automatically  without  further
         action  required of the Issuer or holders  thereof,  upon the following
         terms and conditions:

                                    (i)     If,  at any time  during  the  first
                                            twelve  (12)  months  following  the
                                            Issuance Date,  the Average  Trading
                                            Price  of  the  Common  Stock  is at
                                            least 130% of the Conversion  Price,
                                            then 33-1/3% of the then outstanding
                                            Series  A   Preferred   Shares  will
                                            convert  into  Common  Stock,   such
                                            conversion to be allocated among the
                                            holders thereof, on a pro rata basis
                                            based    upon    their    respective
                                            holdings.

                                     (ii)   If,  at any time  during  the  first
                                            twenty-four  (24)  months  following
                                            the  Issuance   Date,   the  Average
                                            Trading Price of the Common Stock is
                                            equal to or exceeds  the  percentage
                                            of the  Conversion  Price  set forth

         Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  no mandatory  conversion  shall occur
unless and until the shares of Common  Stock to be issued  have been  registered
under the  Securities  Act of 1933,  as  amended,  and listed for trading on the
principal securities exchange or trading market where the Company's Common Stock
is then  listed  or  traded.  Immediately  upon the  occurrence  of a  mandatory
conversion,  the Company will notify all holders of Series A Preferred Shares of
the mandatory conversion.

                           (c)      Certain Definitions.

                                     (i) "CONVERSION  PRICE" means eight dollars
         and  sixty-two  and one-half  cents  ($8.625);  provided  that,  if the
         Average Trading Price as of the second anniversary of the Issuance Date
         is less than eight dollars and sixty-two and one-half  cents  ($8.625),
         then the  Conversion  Price shall  thereafter be adjusted  downward but
         never upward to equal the greater of the Average  Trading  Price or six
         dollars ($6.00), subject to the terms and conditions of Section 4(d).

                                     (ii) "AVERAGE TRADING PRICE" means, as of a
         given  date,  an amount  equal to the  arithmetic  average  of the last
         closing  sale price of the Common Stock on the Nasdaq  National  Market
         (the  "NASDAQ-NM")  for the ten (10) day period ending one day prior to
         the date of  determination as reported by Bloomberg  Financial  Markets
         ("BLOOMBERG"), or, if the Nasdaq-NM is not the principal trading market
         for such security,  the last closing sale price of such security on the
         principal  securities exchange or trading market where such security is
         listed or traded  for the ten (10) day  period  ending one day prior to
         the date of determination as reported by Bloomberg, or if the foregoing
         do not  apply,  the last  closing  bid  price of such  security  in the
         over-the-counter  market  on the  electronic  bulletin  board  for such
         security  for the ten (10) day period  ending one day prior to the date
         of determination as reported by Bloomberg,  or, if no closing bid price
         is reported for such  security by  Bloomberg,  the last  closing  trade
         price of such security as

                                       -4-

<PAGE>



         reported by Bloomberg  or, if no last  closing  trade price is reported
         for such security by  Bloomberg,  the average of the bid prices for the
         ten (10) day period  ending one day prior to the date of  determination
         of any market makers for such security as reported in the "pink sheets"
         by the National Quotation Bureau, Inc.

                           (d)  Adjustment  to  Conversion  Price.  In  order to
         prevent dilution of the conversion  rights granted to holders of Series
         A Preferred Shares  hereunder,  the Conversion Price will be subject to
         adjustment from time to time pursuant to this Section 4(d).

                                     (i) Adjustment for Dilutive Events.  If and
         whenever  on or after the  original  date of  issuance  of the Series A
         Preferred  Shares the Company  issues or sells,  or in accordance  with
         Section  4(d)(ii)  below is  deemed  to have  issued  or  sold,  in one
         transaction or a series of related  transactions,  any shares of Common
         Stock for  consideration  per share less than the  Conversion  Price in
         effect immediately prior to the time of such issue or sale (a "Dilutive
         Event"),  then forthwith upon the occurrence of any such Dilutive Event
         the Conversion  Price will be reduced so that the  Conversion  Price in
         effect immediately following the Dilutive Event will equal the quotient
         derived  by  dividing  (i)  the  sum  of (x)  the  product  derived  by
         multiplying the Conversion  Price in effect  immediately  prior to such
         Dilutive Event times 27,000,000,  plus (y) the product of (A) the Price
         Per  Share  in  the   Dilutive   Event,   times  (B)  three  times  the
         consideration  received by the Company in such Dilutive  Event, by (ii)
         the sum of (x)  27,000,000,  plus (y)  three  times  the  consideration
         received  by the  Company  in the  Dilutive  Event;  provided  that the
         Conversion  Price will not be reduced  pursuant to this sentence if the
         foregoing  calculation results in a Conversion Price in excess of $8.15
         (the "Threshold Price"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the issuance by
         the  Company of any  equity  securities  to  management,  directors  or
         employees  of the  Company  pursuant  to plans and  options to purchase
         equity  securities issued in accordance with such plans approved by the
         Board and in effect as of the date of the first  issuance of the Series
         A Preferred Shares shall not constitute a Dilutive Event.

                                     (ii) Common Stock Deemed  Outstanding.  For
         purposes of  determining  the  adjusted  Conversion  Price  pursuant to
         Section  4(d)(i)  above the  following  events shall be deemed to be an
         issuance and sale of Common Stock by the Company:

                                             (A)  Issuance of Rights or Options.
         If (i) the  Company  in any  manner  grants  any  rights or  options to
         subscribe for or to purchase  shares of Common Stock or any  securities
         convertible  into or  exchangeable  for  shares of Common  Stock  (such
         rights or options  referred to herein as "OPTIONS" and such convertible
         or exchangeable stock or securities  referred to herein as "CONVERTIBLE
         SECURITIES")  and (ii) the Price  Per  Share of shares of Common  Stock
         issuable  upon the  exercise  of such  Options  or upon  conversion  or
         exchange of such  Convertible  Securities  is less than the  Conversion
         Price in effect  immediately  prior to the time of the granting of such
         Options, then (x) the total

                                       -5-

<PAGE>



         maximum  amount of such Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such
         Options or upon  conversion or exchange of the total maximum  number of
         Convertible  Securities issuable upon the exercise of such Options will
         be deemed to be Common Stock  issued and sold by the  Company,  and (y)
         the  consideration  received  pursuant to the Dilutive Event will equal
         the  Price  Per Share  times  the  number of shares of Common  Stock so
         deemed  issued and sold by the  Company.  For  purposes of this Section
         4(d)(ii)(A),  the "Price Per Share" will be  determined by dividing (i)
         the total  amount,  if any,  received or  receivable  by the Company as
         consideration  for the  granting  of such  Options,  plus  the  minimum
         aggregate  amount of  additional  consideration  payable to the Company
         upon  exercise of all such  Options,  plus in the case of such  Options
         which relate to Convertible Securities, the minimum aggregate amount of
         additional  consideration,  if any,  payable  to the  Company  upon the
         issuance or sale of such  Convertible  Securities and the conversion or
         exchange thereof,  by (ii) the total maximum number of shares of Common
         Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or upon the conversion
         or  exchange  of all  such  Convertible  Securities  issuable  upon the
         exercise of such Options. No further adjustment of the Conversion Price
         will be made when  Convertible  Securities are actually issued upon the
         exercise of such Options or when Common  Stock is actually  issued upon
         the  exercise  of such  Options or the  conversion  or exchange of such
         Convertible Securities.

                                             (B)    Issuance   of    Convertible
         Securities.  If (i) the  Company  in any  manner  issues  or sells  any
         Convertible Securities and (ii) the Price Per Share of shares of Common
         Stock  issuable  upon  such  conversion  or  exchange  is less than the
         Conversion Price in effect  immediately prior to the time of such issue
         or sale, then (x) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable
         upon  conversion  or exchange of such  Convertible  Securities  will be
         deemed to be Common Stock  issued and sold by the Company,  and (y) the
         consideration  received  pursuant to the Dilutive  Event will equal the
         Price Per Share  times the  number of shares of Common  Stock so deemed
         issued  and  sold by the  Company.  For the  purposes  of this  Section
         4(d)(ii)(B),  the "Price Per Share" will be  determined by dividing (i)
         the total amount received or receivable by the Company as consideration
         for the issue or sale of such Convertible Securities,  plus the minimum
         aggregate  amount of additional  consideration,  if any, payable to the
         Company  upon the  conversion  or exchange  thereof,  by (ii) the total
         maximum  number of shares of Common Stock  issuable upon the conversion
         or exchange of all such Convertible  Securities.  No further adjustment
         of the  Conversion  Price will be made when  Common  Stock is  actually
         issued upon the conversion or exchange of such Convertible  Securities,
         and if any such issue or sale of such  Convertible  Securities  is made
         upon exercise of any Options for which  adjustments  to the  Conversion
         Price had been or are to be made pursuant to Section 4(d)(ii)(A) above,
         no further adjustment of the Conversion Price will be made by reason of
         such issue or sale.

                                             (C)  Change  in  Option   Price  or
         Conversion  Rate.  If at any time there is a change in (i) the purchase
         price provided for in any Options,  (ii) the additional  consideration,
         if any, payable upon the conversion or exchange of any

                                       -6-

<PAGE>



         Convertible  Securities,  or (iii)  the rate at which  any  Convertible
         Securities are convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock,  then
         the  Conversion  Price in  effect  at the time of such  change  will be
         readjusted to the Conversion  Price which would have been in effect had
         those Options or Convertible  Securities still  outstanding at the time
         of such change  provided for such changed  purchase  price,  additional
         consideration  or changed  conversion  rate, as the case may be, at the
         time such Options or Convertible  Securities  were  initially  granted,
         issued or sold.

                                             (D)  Calculation  of  Consideration
         Received. If any shares of Common Stock, Option or Convertible Security
         are issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash,  the
         consideration received therefor or the Price Per Share, as the case may
         be,  will be deemed to be the net amount  received  or to be  received,
         respectively,  by the  Company  therefor.  In case any shares of Common
         Stock,  Options  or  Convertible  Securities  are  issued or sold for a
         consideration  other than cash, the amount of the  consideration  other
         than cash received by the Company or the non-cash  portion of the Price
         Per  Share,  as the  case  may  be,  will  be the  fair  value  of such
         consideration received or to be received, respectively, by the Company;
         except where such consideration  consists of securities,  in which case
         the amount of consideration  received or to be received,  respectively,
         by the Company will be the Average Trading Price thereof as of the date
         of  receipt.  If any shares of Common  Stock,  Options  or  Convertible
         Securities  are  issued  in  connection  with any  merger  in which the
         Company  is the  surviving  corporation,  the  amount of  consideration
         therefor will be deemed to be the fair value of such portion of the net
         assets and business of the non-surviving corporation as is attributable
         to such shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible  Securities,  as
         the case may be.  The fair value of any  consideration  other than cash
         and  securities  will be  determined  jointly  by the  Company  and the
         holders of a majority of the outstanding  Series A Preferred Shares. If
         such parties are unable to reach agreement  within a reasonable  period
         of time, the fair value of such  consideration will be determined by an
         independent  appraiser  jointly selected by the Company and the holders
         of a majority of the outstanding Series A Preferred Shares.

                                             (E)  Integrated  Transactions.   In
         case any Option is issued in  connection  with the  issuance or sale of
         other  securities of the Company,  together  comprising  one integrated
         transaction  in which no specific  consideration  is  allocated to such
         Option by the parties  thereto,  the Option will be deemed to have been
         issued for a consideration of $.01.

                                             (F)  Record  Date.  If the  Company
         takes a record of the  holders  of  Common  Stock  for the  purpose  of
         entitling them (i) to receive a dividend or other distribution  payable
         in shares of Common Stock, Options or in Convertible Securities or (ii)
         to  subscribe  for or  purchase  shares of  Common  Stock,  Options  or
         Convertible Securities,  then such record date will be deemed to be the
         date of the  issuance or sale of the shares of Common  Stock  deemed to
         have been issued or sold upon the

                                       -7-

<PAGE>



         declaration  of  such  dividend  or  upon  the  making  of  such  other
         distribution  or the date of the granting of such right of subscription
         or purchase, as the case may be.

                                     (iii)  Adjustment of Conversion  Price upon
         Subdivision or Combination of Common Stock.  If the Company at any time
         subdivides (by any stock split,  stock  dividend,  recapitalization  or
         otherwise)  one or more  classes  of its  outstanding  shares of Common
         Stock  into a greater  number of  shares,  the  Conversion  Price,  the
         Threshold  Price and the amounts set forth in Section 4(c)(i) in effect
         immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately  reduced,
         and if the Company at any time combines (by combination,  reverse stock
         split or otherwise)  one or more classes of its  outstanding  shares of
         Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the Conversion Price, the
         Threshold  Price and the amounts set forth in Section 4(c)(i) in effect
         immediately   prior  to  such  combination   will  be   proportionately
         increased.

                                     (iv)   Reorganization,    Reclassification,
         Consolidation,  Merger or Sale. Any  recapitalization,  reorganization,
         reclassification,  consolidation,  merger, sale of all or substantially
         all of the  Company's  assets to another  Person (as defined  below) or
         other  transaction  which is  effected  in such a way that  holders  of
         Common  Stock  are  entitled  to  receive  (either   directly  or  upon
         subsequent  liquidation) stock, securities or assets with respect to or
         in exchange for Common Stock is referred to herein as "ORGANIC CHANGE."
         Prior to the consummation of any Organic Change,  the Company will make
         appropriate  provision  to ensure  that (I) each of the  holders of the
         Series A Preferred Shares will thereafter have the right to acquire and
         receive  in lieu of or  addition  to (as the case may be) the shares of
         Common Stock immediately theretofore acquirable and receivable upon the
         conversion of such holder's Series A Preferred  Shares,  such shares of
         stock, securities or assets as may be issued or payable with respect to
         or in  exchange  for the number of shares of Common  Stock  immediately
         theretofore  acquirable  and  receivable  upon the  conversion  of such
         holder's  Series A Preferred  Shares had such Organic  Change not taken
         place and (II) each of the  holders of Series A  Preferred  Shares will
         continue  to have the same  rights and  preferences,  in any  surviving
         entity,  as those which apply to the Series A Preferred Shares pursuant
         to  this  Certificate.   In  any  such  case,  the  Company  will  make
         appropriate   provision  with  respect  to  such  holders'  rights  and
         interests  to ensure  that the  provisions  of this  Section  4(d) will
         thereafter be applicable to the Series A Preferred Shares.  The Company
         will not effect any such consolidation, merger or sale, unless prior to
         the  consummation  thereof,  the  successor  entity  (if other than the
         Company)   resulting  from   consolidation  or  merger  or  the  entity
         purchasing such assets assumes, by written  instrument,  the obligation
         to deliver to each holder of Series A  Preferred  Shares such shares of
         stock,  securities  or assets  as,  in  accordance  with the  foregoing
         provisions, such holder may be entitled to acquire. "Person" shall mean
         an individual,  a limited  liability  company,  a partnership,  a joint
         venture, a corporation,  a trust, an unincorporated  organization and a
         government or any department or agency thereof.

                                    (v)     Notices.

                                             (A) Immediately upon any adjustment
         of the Conversion  Price,  the Company will give written notice thereof
         to  each  holder  of  Series  A  Preferred  Shares,  setting  forth  in
         reasonable detail and certifying the calculation of such adjustment.

                                             (B) The Company  will give  written
         notice to each holder of Series A Preferred Shares at least twenty (20)
         days prior to the date on which the Company closes its books or takes a
         record (I) with respect to any dividend or distribution upon the Common
         Stock, (II) with respect to any pro rata subscription  offer to holders
         of Common Stock or (III) for determining rights to vote with respect to
         any Organic  Change,  dissolution or  liquidation;  provided that in no
         event  shall  such  notice be  provided  to such  holder  prior to such
         information being made known to the public.

                                             (C)  The  Company  will  also  give
         written  notice to each  holder of Series A  Preferred  Shares at least
         twenty  (20)  days  prior  to the  date on which  any  Organic  Change,
         dissolution or liquidation will take place.

                                             (D) The Company  shall give written
         notice to the holders of the Series A Preferred  Shares  promptly after
         the  occurrence of the  automatic  conversion of the Series A Preferred
         Shares into Common Stock as set forth in Section 4(b) hereof.

                           (e)  Mechanics  of  Conversion.  Subject  to  and  in
         compliance with all federal and state  securities  laws, the conversion
         of Series A Preferred  Shares pursuant to this Section 4 will be deemed
         to have been effected (and the holder  thereof will be deemed to be the
         registered   holder  of  the  Conversion   Shares),   automatically  if
         conversion is pursuant to Section 4(b),  or, if converted at the option
         of the holder of Series A Preferred Shares pursuant to Section 4(a), by
         and on the date of surrender of certificates  representing the Series A
         Preferred  Shares being converted to the Company at its principal place
         of business,  together with the Notice of Conversion attached hereto as
         Exhibit I. As soon as practicable,  but in no event later than five (5)
         business  days after  such  conversion,  the  Company  shall  cause the
         transfer  agent to  deliver  to the  registered  holder  thereof  (a) a
         certificate representing the shares of Common Stock to which the holder
         is entitled as a result of such  conversion,  and (b) a new certificate
         for Series A Preferred  Shares for the  unconverted  shares of Series A
         Preferred Shares, if any,  represented by the surrendered  certificate.
         The Company shall at all times reserve for issuance a sufficient number
         of shares of Common Stock to be issued as Conversion  Shares,  and upon
         issuance  thereof,  the  Conversion  Shares  shall  be  fully  paid and
         nonassessable.

                           (f) Record Holder.  The person or persons entitled to
         receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon a conversion of Series
         A  Preferred  Shares  shall be treated  for all  purposes as the record
         holder or  holders  of such  shares of Common  Stock on the  Conversion
         Date.

                  (5)  Change of  Control.  If at any time  there is a Change of
         Control  (as  defined  below)  of  the  Company,   the  Company  shall,
         immediately  following the occurrence of any such event,  send a notice
         to each holder offering to repurchase the Series A Preferred Shares (or
         at each holder's  option,  any portion  thereof) for an amount equal to
         the  Liquidation  Preference  on the  date of such  repurchase.  If any
         holder  desires to accept  such offer in whole or in part,  such holder
         must advise the Company of such  acceptance  within thirty (30) days of
         the date of receiving  such notice.  The Company shall then  repurchase
         the Series A  Preferred  Shares or  portion  thereof  so  tendered  for
         repurchase  by such holder by paying the  purchase  price to the holder
         (or any person or persons  designated by such holder in such acceptance
         notice), in immediately  available funds, within ten (10) business days
         of the  Company's  receipt of such  holder's  acceptance  notice.  If a
         holder  tenders  only a portion  of such  holder's  Series A  Preferred
         Shares, the holder shall deliver such certificate of Series A Preferred
         Shares to the Company and the Company  then shall issue to the holder a
         new certificate of Series A Preferred Shares,  representing the portion
         of the Series A Preferred  Shares not  repurchased by the Company.  For
         purposes of this Section, "Change of Control" means any event or series
         of events by which (i) any person or group (as defined in Rule 13d-1 of
         the Exchange  Act) obtains a majority (by voting or  otherwise)  of the
         securities  of the Company  ordinarily  having the right to vote in the
         election of  directors;  (ii) during any two year period  commencing at
         any time on or after the Closing Date, individuals who at the beginning
         of such period constituting the Board of Directors cease for any reason
         to  constitute  a majority of the Board of  Directors;  (iii) any sale,
         lease,  exchange or other  transfer (in one  transaction or a series of
         related  transactions) of all, or substantially  all, the assets of the
         Company;  (iv) the merger or  consolidation of the Company with or into
         another  corporation  or the  merger of  another  corporation  into the
         Company with the effect that  immediately  after such  transaction  any
         beneficial  owner shall have become the beneficial  owner of securities
         of  the  surviving   corporation   of  such  merger  or   consolidation
         representing a majority of the combined voting power of the outstanding
         securities of the surviving corporation  ordinarily having the right to
         vote  in the  election  of  directors;  or (v) the  adoption  of a plan
         leading   to  the   liquidation   or   dissolution   of  the   Company.
         Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the Company shall not be obligated to
         repurchase the Series A Preferred  Shares pursuant to the terms of this
         Section 5 if such  repurchase  in the  opinion  of the  Company's  then
         current auditors,  would jeopardize the "pooling"  accounting treatment
         of the transaction giving rise to such Change of Control.

                  (6) Taxes.  The Company  shall pay any and all taxes which may
         be imposed  upon it with respect to the issuance and delivery of Common
         Stock upon the  conversion  of the Series A Preferred  Shares as herein
         provided.  The  Company  shall not be  required in any event to pay any
         transfer or other taxes by reason of the  issuance of such Common Stock
         in names  other  than  those in which  the  Series A  Preferred  Shares
         surrendered for conversion are registered on the Company's records, and
         no such conversion or issuance of Common Stock shall be made unless and
         until the person requesting such issuance has

                                      -10-

<PAGE>



         paid to the Company the amount of any such tax, or has  established  to
         the  satisfaction  of the Company and its transfer  agent, if any, that
         such tax has been paid.

                  (7) Liquidation,  Dissolution, Winding-Up. In the event of any
         voluntary or involuntary liquidation,  dissolution or winding up of the
         Company, the holders of the Series A Preferred Shares shall be entitled
         to  receive  in cash out of the  assets of the  Company,  whether  from
         capital or from earnings available for distribution to its stockholders
         (the "PREFERRED FUNDS"), before any amount shall be paid to the holders
         of any of the capital  stock of the Company of any class junior in rank
         to the Series A Preferred  Shares in respect of the  preferences  as to
         the  distributions  and payments on the  liquidation,  dissolution  and
         winding up of the Company, an amount per Series A Preferred Share equal
         to the  Liquidation  Preference;  provided that, if the Preferred Funds
         are  insufficient to pay the full amount due to the holders of Series A
         Preferred  Shares,  then each holder of Series A Preferred Shares shall
         receive a percentage of the Preferred Funds equal to the full amount of
         Preferred  Funds  payable to such  holder as a  percentage  of the full
         amount of Preferred  Funds payable to all holders of Series A Preferred
         Shares.  The  purchase  or  redemption  by the  Company of stock of any
         class,  in any manner  permitted  by law,  shall not,  for the purposes
         hereof, be regarded as a liquidation,  dissolution or winding up of the
         Company.  Neither the  consolidation  or merger of the Company  with or
         into any other Person,  nor the sale or transfer by the Company of less
         than  substantially all of its assets,  shall, for the purposes hereof,
         be  deemed  to be a  liquidation,  dissolution  or  winding  up of  the
         Company.  No holder of Series A Preferred  Shares  shall be entitled to
         receive  any  amounts  with  respect  thereto  upon  any   liquidation,
         dissolution  or  winding  up of the  Company  other  than  the  amounts
         provided for herein.

                  (8)  Repurchases  of Series A  Preferred  Stock by the Issuer.
         Neither the Issuer nor any of its  subsidiaries  shall  repurchase  any
         outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock unless the Issuer on the
         same terms  either (i) offers to purchase  all of the then  outstanding
         shares of Series A Preferred Stock or (ii) offers to purchase shares of
         Series  A  Preferred  Stock  from  the  holders  in  proportion  to the
         respective  number of shares of Series A  Preferred  Stock held by each
         holder.   In  any  such   repurchase  by  the  Issuer  or  any  of  its
         subsidiaries,  if all shares of Series A Preferred  Stock are not being
         repurchased,  then the number of shares of Series A Preferred  Stock to
         be  repurchased  shall  be  allocated  among  all  shares  of  Series A
         Preferred  Stock held by holders  which accept the Issuer's  repurchase
         offer so that the shares of Series A  Preferred  Stock are  repurchased
         from such holders in proportion to the  respective  number of shares of
         Series A  Preferred  Stock held by each such holder  which  accepts the
         Issuer's  offer  (or in such  other  proportion  as  agreed by all such
         holders who accept the Issuer's offer).

                  (9)  Shares to be  Retired.  Any  share of Series A  Preferred
         Stock  converted,  redeemed,  repurchased or otherwise  acquired by the
         Corporation shall be retired and canceled and may not be reissued.


                                      -11-

<PAGE>



                  (10) No Fractional  Shares. In connection with any conversion,
         liquidation,  redemption,  or  otherwise,  the Company shall only issue
         Common Stock in denominations equal to the nearest, lower whole number;
         fractional  shares due holders will be  allocated  their cash value and
         paid by the Company to the holder by check.

                  (11)  Preferred  Rank.  All  shares  of  Common  Stock and all
         additional  shares of preferred stock of the Company shall be of junior
         rank to all Series A Preferred  Shares in respect to the preferences as
         to  dividends  and  distributions  and payments  upon the  liquidation,
         dissolution  and winding up of the Company and the rights of the shares
         of Common  Stock and of any shares of preferred  stock,  other than the
         Series A  Preferred  Stock  shall be  subject  to the  preferences  and
         relative rights of the Series A Preferred Shares.

                  (12) Vote to Change  the Terms of Series A  Preferred  Shares.
         The  affirmative  vote at a meeting duly called for such purpose or the
         written  consent  without a  meeting  of the  holders  of not less than
         two-thirds  (2/3) of the then  outstanding  Series A  Preferred  Shares
         (excluding  any  Series  A  Preferred  Shares  held by the  Company  or
         affiliates of the Company)  shall be required for the Company to amend,
         alter,  change or repeal any of the powers,  designations,  preferences
         and rights of the Series A Preferred Shares.

                  (13) Lost or Stolen Certificates.  Upon receipt by the Company
         of evidence satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction
         or mutilation  of any preferred  stock  certificates  representing  the
         Series  A  Preferred  Shares,  and  (in  the  case of  loss,  theft  or
         destruction)  of any  indemnification  undertaking by the holder to the
         Company  that is  reasonably  satisfactory  to the  Company,  and  upon
         surrender and  cancellation of the preferred stock  certificate(s),  if
         mutilated,  the Company shall  execute and deliver new preferred  stock
         certificate(s) of like tenor and date.  However,  the Company shall not
         be  obligated  to  re-issue  such  lost  or  stolen   preferred   stock
         certificates  if  holder  contemporaneously  requests  the  Company  to
         convert such Series A Preferred Shares into Common Stock.

Stock. Anixter agrees that, if he shall receive and determine to accept any bona
fide  written  offer (a "Notice of Offer") from a Buyer to purchase or otherwise
acquire  for value,  in one  transaction  or a series of  related  transactions,
shares  of Common  Stock  (the  "Offer  Shares")  beneficially  owned by him and
representing 20% or more of all of the then issued and outstanding  Common Stock
of the Company beneficially owned by Anixter,  each of the Purchasers shall have
the right to  participate  in such  transaction  in the manner set forth in this
Agreement.  The term "Buyer",  as used herein,  means a person or entity,  other
than Anixter or any other person or entity  directly or indirectly  controlling,
controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with Anixter,  that has
offered to purchase or otherwise acquire for value shares of Common Stock of the
Company (other than in connection with a registered public offering).



<PAGE>



                  0.2 Notifications.  Anixter shall,  promptly after his receipt
of a Notice  of Offer  (and in any  event  not  later  than 10 days  after  such
receipt), send a copy thereof to the Company and to each of the Purchasers.  The
delivery of such  Notice of Offer shall be effected  not less than 60 days prior
to the closing of such  proposed  sale or other  acquisition.  Upon receipt of a
Notice of Offer,  each Purchaser  shall have 30 days to deliver a written notice
of its  election to  participate  in such sale or other  acquisition  and of the
number of its Covered  Shares to be included in such sale or other  acquisition,
which Covered Shares shall be converted into Conversion  Shares,  subject to and
effective upon the closing of such sale or other acquisition; provided, however,
that such number of Conversion Shares to be included shall not exceed the number
determined  in Section  1.3 below.  If such  written  notice of  election is not
received from a Purchaser  within the 30-day  period  specified  above,  Anixter
shall have the right to sell or otherwise transfer the aforesaid Common Stock to
the Buyer without any participation by such Purchaser, but only (a) on the terms
and  conditions  stated  in the  Notice  of  Offer  and (b) if the sale or other
transfer is  consummated  not later than 60 days after the end of the  aforesaid
60-day period.

                  0.3 Selling a Proportionate  Number of Shares of Common Stock.
Each Purchaser shall have the right to sell or transfer,  pursuant to the Notice
of Offer,  Conversion Shares  representing the same percentage of the Conversion
Shares  into  which  all  Covered  Shares  owned  by  such  Purchaser  are  then
convertible  as the  Offer  Shares  are of  all  shares  of  Common  Stock  then
beneficially owned by Anixter.  In the event the number of Conversion Shares for
which Purchasers  elect to exercise such right,  along with the Offer Shares and
any other shares of the Company to be sold or transferred by other  shareholders
of the Company pursuant to any similar rights granted to such other shareholders
prior to the date hereof, exceed the number of shares which the Buyer is willing
to purchase, the number of shares to be sold or transferred to the Buyer by each
transferor  shall be  reduced so that each  transferor  is  entitled  to sell or
transfer the same percentage of its shares as each other transferor.

                  0.4 Purchase Price of Covered  Shares.  The purchase price for
each Conversion Share ("Purchase  Price") of the Purchasers under this Agreement
and the terms of the purchase or other acquisition  thereof shall be the same as
are  applicable  to the  purchase or other  acquisition  of each share of Common
Stock of Anixter  and shall be as set forth in such  Notice of Offer;  provided,
however,   that  the   Purchasers   shall  not  be   required   to  provide  any
representation,  warranty or other  undertaking other than with respect to their
ownership of, and authority to sell or transfer,  such Conversion Shares free of
any liens or encumbrances.

                  0.5 Closing of Sale.  Each Purchaser in respect of a Notice of
Offer  shall  deliver to the Buyer in respect of such  Notice of Offer,  against
payment of the total  purchase  price for the Covered Shares to be purchased (at
the price  per share  specified  above in  Section  1.4),  on the  closing  date
specified in such Notice of Offer,  a certificate or  certificates  representing
the number of such Covered  Shares which it has elected to sell pursuant to this
Agreement,  together with  appropriate  instruments of transfer duly endorsed in
blank.

         1.   Entire Agreement. his Agreement and the other documents referenced
herein  contain the entire  agreement  between the parties  with  respect to the
subject matter hereof and

                                       -2-

<PAGE>



supersede any and all prior  arrangements and  understandings,  both written and
oral, with respect thereto.

         2.  Severability. It is the desire and intent of the parties  that the
provisions of this Agreement be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under
the law and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is
sought.  Accordingly, in the event that any provision of this Agreement would be
held in any  jurisdiction  to be invalid,  prohibits  or  unenforceable  for any
reason, such provision, as to such jurisdiction,  shall be ineffective,  without
invalidating  the  remaining  provisions  of this  Agreement  or  affecting  the
validity  or  enforceability  of  such  provision  in  any  other  jurisdiction.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such provision could be more narrowly drawn so
as not to be invalid,  prohibited  or  unenforceable  in such  jurisdiction,  it
shall, as to such  jurisdiction,  be so narrowly drawn without  invalidating the
remaining   provisions   of  this   Agreement  or  affecting   the  validity  or
enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

         3.  Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Agreement  shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns.

         4.  Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with
and governed by the law of the State of Delaware,  without  giving effect to the
principles of conflict of laws thereof.

         5.  Counterparts;  Effectiveness.  This  Agreement may be signed in any
number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect
as if the  signatures  thereof  and hereto were upon the same  instrument.  This
Agreement  shall become  effective  when each party  hereto shall have  received
counterparts hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto.

         6.  Notice.  Whenever a party to this  Agreement  is  required  to give
notice to any other party  hereunder,  such notice shall be given at the address
set forth next to such party's name on the signature  page of this  Agreement or
at such  other  address  as the  parties  designate  to each  by  giving  notice
hereunder, and such notice shall be made in writing and deemed to have been duly
delivered  when (a)  delivered  by hand (b) one day after upon  confirmation  of
delivery by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service or (c) three days
after sent by Certified U.S. Mail, return receipt requested.  A copy of any such
notices delivered to Anixter or the Company shall also be delivered to:

<PAGE>



all such other action as may be required to preserve the limited liability of
the Limited Partners in any jurisdiction in which the Partnership shall conduct
operations.

         SECTION 3.05. Management Agreement. The General Partner, in the name
and on behalf of the Partnership, is authorized to enter into a Management
Agreement dated of even date herewith, in the form attached hereto as SCHEDULE B
(the "MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT"), with Robert Fleming Inc. (the "MANAGEMENT
COMPANY"), with such Management Agreement to be subject to amendment only with
the consent of the Limited Partners and the limited partner of the Offshore
Partnership, voting together as a single class. If for any reason the Management
Agreement should terminate prior to the dissolution of the Partnership, the
General Partner shall (1) promptly give written notification to the Limited
Partners of such termination, (2) at the General Partner's option, either
contract with another management company, in the name and on behalf of the
Partnership, or arrange for the services previously provided by the Management
Company to be rendered directly by the General Partner to the Partnership, and
(3) pay from Partnership funds on behalf of the Partnership the fees and
expenses incurred by the Partnership in clause (2) above. The fee payable to the
Management Company pursuant to the Management Agreement (the "MANAGEMENT FEE")
shall be paid by the Partnership and shall not (i) be considered a distribution
of profits or a return of capital to the General Partner for any purpose under
this Agreement or (ii) reduce the balance in any Partner's Contributions
Account, but shall constitute a Partnership expense to be taken into account in
determining Net Gain or Loss pursuant to Article X hereof.

         SECTION 3.06.  Salaries.

         (a)  While the Management Agreement is in effect, the General Partner,
the partners of the General Partner and the members of the General Partner's
general partner shall receive no salaries from the Partnership. In the event
that the Management Agreement is terminated prior to dissolution and completion
of liquidation of the Partnership, after the date of such termination, the
partners of the General Partner and the members of the General Partner's general
partner shall be entitled to receive such compensation from the Partnership as
the General Partner may determine, provided that, except as otherwise approved
by a majority in interest of the Limited Partners, the aggregate amount of
compensation paid annually by the Partnership to any Person or Persons (under
this Section 3.06(a) and clause 3 of the second sentence of Section 3.05) for
services of the type previously provided to the Partnership by the Management
Company shall not exceed the Management Fee for the calendar year preceding the
year in which the Management Agreement was terminated.

         (b)  Any partner of the General Partner and any member of the General
Partner's general partner shall be permitted to receive fees, commissions or
other compensation from Persons other than the Partnership; provided, however,
that so long as the Management Agreement is in effect, or the services provided
by the Management Company are provided by the General Partner or an Affiliate of
the General Partner, neither the General Partner, nor any



                                      - 4 -


<PAGE>



(1) partner of the General Partner, (2) member of the General Partner's general
partner, (3) officer, director or employee of the Management Company or (4)
member of the Advisory Committee shall receive any directors' fees, consulting
fees or other remuneration for services from any Portfolio Company, except
reimbursement for expenses.

         SECTION 3.07.  Co-Investment with Offshore Partnership.

         (a)  The General Partner also is serving as a general partner of the
Offshore Partnership. It is the policy of the Partnership and the policy of the
Offshore Partnership to conduct their investment activities in parallel (other
than those activities involving the use of idle funds pending investment). To
implement this policy, the General Partner, to the extent commercially
reasonable, will:

             (1)   apportion available investment opportunities between the
             Partnership and the Offshore Partnership in proportion to the
             relative amounts of capital committed to each such partnership;

             (2)   cause the Partnership and the Offshore Partnership to sell or
             otherwise dispose of each such investment at substantially the same
             time and on substantially the same terms in amounts proportionate
             to the relative size of the investments made by the Partnership and
             the Offshore Partnership in the securities of that Portfolio
             Company; and

             (3)   cause the Partnership or the Offshore Partnership to sell or
             buy from each other securities of Portfolio Companies, at cost, so
             as to maintain to the extent feasible the relationship between the
             capital committed to each partnership and the holdings of each
             partnership in the securities of each Portfolio Company if the
             relative amounts of capital committed to the Partnership and the
             Offshore Partnership, respectively, should change between the
             Initial Closing and the Final Closing.

         (b)  The Partnership shall bear its proportionate share, based on the
relative amount it invests, of all expenses incurred in connection with each
investment made in parallel with the Offshore Partnership, but shall not bear
any expenses incurred solely for the benefit of the Offshore Partnership.

         SECTION 3.08.  Other Activities.

         (a)  The General Partner, the general partner of the General Partner
and the members of the General Partner's general partner shall devote such time
and effort to the activities of the Partnership as may be necessary to promote
adequately the interests of the Partnership and the mutual interests of the
Partners. It is specifically understood and agreed that time and effort



                                      - 5 -


<PAGE>



devoted by the General Partner, the general partner of the General Partner and
the members of the General Partner's general partner to the affairs of the
Partnership, the Offshore Partnership, the Management Company and any other
entity affiliated with the Partnership, including for this purpose any Portfolio
Company, shall be considered time and effort devoted to the activities of the
Partnership only to the extent it is in or not opposed to the best interests of
the Partnership.

         (b)  It is specifically understood and agreed that, without the prior
written consent of a majority in interest of the Limited Partners of the
Partnership and the limited partner of the Offshore Partnership, voting together
as a single class, neither the General Partner nor the general partner of the
General Partner and the members of the General Partner's general partner, shall
act as a general partner or similar principal of a private equity fund formed
after the date hereof to pursue an investment strategy similar to that of the
Partnership (a "SUCCESSOR ENTITY") until the earlier of (1) the date on which at
least 75% of the Partnership's aggregate Subscriptions has been invested,
expended, committed to be invested, or reserved for future investment in
entities which at such time are already Portfolio Companies or for reasonably
anticipated Partnership expenses and liabilities or (2) the end of the
Commitment Period. Solely for the purposes of determining whether the 75%
threshold has been met, the aggregate amount reserved for future investment and
for Partnership expenses and liabilities shall be subject to approval of the
Advisory Committee, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.

         (c)  Neither the Partnership nor any Partner shall by virtue of this
Agreement have any right, title or interest in or to any Successor Entity.

         SECTION 3.09. Avoidance of Conflicts of Interest. The Partnership and
the Offshore Partnership have adopted the following policies to deal with
potential conflicts of interest.

         (a)  Except for transactions that are specifically permitted under the
terms and provisions of this Agreement or as otherwise approved by the Advisory
Committee, the Partnership shall not engage in any investment or other financial
transaction with any Partner, or any partner of any Partner, other than
transactions entered into in the ordinary course of the Partnership's activities
on terms no less favorable to the Partnership than are generally afforded to
unrelated third parties in comparable transactions.

         (b)  The partners, officers, directors, managers, members and employees
of the General Partner and its general partner may invest for their own accounts
in the securities of any Portfolio Company only on terms no better than those
available to the Partnership, and only after the General Partner has made
available to the Partnership all investment opportunities in such Portfolio
Companies which come to the attention of the General Partner and its partners,
except for such opportunities which the General Partner and its partners
reasonably believe are not within the purposes of or appropriate for the
Partnership.


                                      - 6 -


<PAGE>



         (c)  The General Partner in its sole discretion may offer co-investment
opportunities to Limited Partners who express an interest in co-investment
opportunities in writing. Such co-investment opportunities shall be offered on
terms identical or substantially similar to the Partnership, and the General
Partner intends to do so when possible and appropriate. The General Partner
shall not provide any investment advice to any Limited Partner with respect to
any such co-investment opportunity. Any Limited Partner participating in any
such co-investment opportunity shall be responsible for making its own decision
as to the merits of such opportunity and the co-investment opportunity offered
to any Limited Partner shall not contain a recommendation to any Limited Partner
that such investment is suitable for the particular Limited Partner. The Limited
Partners hereby acknowledge and agree that the General Partner may also offer to
other private investors, groups, partnerships, or corporations, the right to
participate in investment opportunities made available to the Partnership
whenever the General Partner, in its discretion, so determines.

         (d)  Each Partner agrees that any other Partner and its respective
partners, officers, directors, members, managers, employees and Affiliates may
invest, participate, or engage in (for their own accounts or for the accounts of
others), or may possess an interest in, other financial ventures and investment
and professional activities of every kind and description, independently or with
others and may receive fees, commissions, remuneration or reimbursement of
expenses in connection with these activities, whether or not such activities may
conflict with any interest of the Partnership or any of the Partners (provided,
that, the General Partner, the general partner of the General Partner and the
members of the General Partner's general partner are further subject to Section
3.08 and the other provisions of this Section 3.09). The parties hereto
expressly agree that neither the Partnership nor any Partner shall have any
rights in or to activities permitted by this Section 3.09(d) or to any fees,
income, profits or goodwill derived therefrom.

         SECTION 3.10. Duty of Care. It is recognized that decisions concerning
investments or potential investments involve the exercise of judgment and the
risk of loss. The General Partner and its partners shall exercise their best
judgment in making investments on behalf of the Partnership and in carrying out
their other obligations hereunder and they shall not incur any liability for
effecting such investments all to the extent they are entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Section 18.01 hereof. The General Partner, its
partners (including each such partner's officers, directors, employees,
managers, members and agents), and their Affiliates shall not be liable to the
Partnership or any other Partner for honest mistakes of judgment or for losses
due to such mistakes or for the negligence, whether of omission or commission,
dishonesty or bad faith of any employee, broker or other agent of the
Partnership selected and retained by any of them with reasonable care. The
General Partner, its partners (including each such partner's officers,
directors, employees, members, managers and agents), and their Affiliates shall
be fully protected and justified with respect to any action or omission taken or
suffered by any of them in good faith if such action or omission is taken or
suffered in reliance upon and in accordance with the opinion or advice as to
matters of law of legal counsel, or as to matters of accounting of



                                      - 7 -


<PAGE>



accountants, or as to matters of valuation of investment bankers or appraisers,
selected and retained by any of them with reasonable care.

         SECTION 3.11.  Investment Limitations.

         (a)  Without the prior approval of the Advisory Committee, the
Partnership shall not:

             (1)
             invest more than 15% of the aggregate Subscriptions of all Partners
             and subscriptions of all partners of the Offshore Partnership, in
             the securities of any single Portfolio Company (including, for this
             purpose, the outstanding balance of any indebtedness of such
             Portfolio Company that the Partnership has guaranteed);

             (2)
             invest more than 15% of the aggregate Subscriptions of all Partners
             and subscriptions of all partners of the Offshore Partnership, in
             companies which, at the time of such investment, do not have any
             equity securities traded on a Public Securities Market; and

             (3)
             purchase on a Public Securities Market Portfolio Company equity
             securities if the Partnership's cumulative Cost of all such
             purchases held by the Partnership at such time would exceed 5% of
             the aggregate Subscriptions of all Partners and the subscriptions
             of all partners of the Offshore Fund.

         (b)  The Partnership shall not participate in (i) investments actively
opposed by the board of directors of the potential Portfolio Company; (ii)
investments in companies undergoing bankruptcy liquidations; or (iii)
investments in real estate.

         (c)  The General Partner shall use its best efforts to cause the
Partnership to conduct its affairs in a manner that limits the Partnership's
operations to investments and other related activities which, taken together,
would not cause the Partnership to be treated for United States federal income
tax purposes as engaged in a "trade or business within the United States,"
within the meaning of Section 864(b) of the Code, during any taxable year of the
Partnership.
Accordingly, the Partnership shall not:


             (1)
             acquire either any direct interest in United States real estate or
             any other interest, including an interest in a corporation, which
             would be treated as a "United States real property interest" within
             the meaning of Section 897(c) of the Code at the time of its
             acquisition by the Partnership;



                                      - 8 -


<PAGE>




             (2)
             acquire an interest in any partnership, trust or other
             non-corporate entity, unless (A) the General Partner determines,
             after consultation with counsel to the Partnership, that such
             proposed acquisition will not cause the Partnership to be treated
             as engaged in a trade or business within the United States for
             United States tax purposes, and (B) such entity agrees to be bound
             contractually by restrictions substantially similar to those set
             forth in this Section 3.11(c);


             (3)
             acquire and dispose of securities or other assets on a regular and
             frequent basis with a view to realizing short-term gains from
             market fluctuations; provided, however, that the Partnership (A)
             may make temporary investments of its funds not yet invested in
             securities of Portfolio Companies or used to pay Partnership
             expenses, and (B) shall attempt to minimize the frequency of such
             investment transactions and otherwise to conduct such temporary
             investment activity in a prudent and conservative manner consistent
             with the Partnership's objectives as set forth in Section 2.03;

             (4)
             invest in or enter into contracts for the purchase or sale of
             commodities;

             (5)
             invest in options or futures, including currency futures, other
             than options or other contracts for the acquisition of securities
             of a Portfolio Company;


             (6)
             make any investment with borrowed funds; provided, however, that
             the limitation set forth in this Section 3.11(c)(6) shall not
             preclude the Partnership from borrowing on a short-term basis or
             guaranteeing the obligations of a Portfolio Company, each to the
             extent permitted by Section 3.14; or


             (7)
             engage in or hold itself out as engaging in the performance of
             services for compensation, or otherwise carry on directly a trade
             or business.

         (d)  The restrictions set forth in Section 3.11(c) are intended to
ensure that the activities of the Partnership will be conducted so as to avoid
United States federal income taxation on the income of the Partnership allocated
to the Limited Partners (other than



                                      - 9 -


<PAGE>



withholding tax on dividends and certain interest payments received from United
States sources). To this end, in addition to complying with the specific
restrictions set forth in Section 3.11(c), the General Partner shall use its
best efforts, to the extent practicable and consistent with the Partnership's
investment program:


             (1)
             not to engage in any activity that would subject the income of the
             Partnership allocated to the Limited Partners to United States
             federal income taxation (other than withholding tax on dividends
             and certain interest payments received from United States sources);
             and


             (2)
             in the event that the Code or the regulations promulgated
             thereunder are from time to time amended so as to require
             additional or different restrictions on Partnership activities and
             investments in order to avoid such taxation, to observe such
             additional or different restrictions.

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that legislative,
judicial or regulatory changes occurring after the date hereof may cause
Partners that are not United States Persons to become subject to United States
federal, state or local income tax on their respective shares of capital gains
realized by the Partnership that are not effectively connected with a trade or
business within the United States, within the meaning of Section 864 of the
Code, carried on by the Partnership, whether such income taxes are collected by
withholding or otherwise, the preceding sentence shall not apply with respect to
any such taxes.

         (e)  In making temporary investments of idle Partnership funds, the
General Partner shall use its best efforts to make such investments so as to
minimize withholding of United States income tax at the source with respect to
the shares of Partnership income and gains allocable to the Limited Partners. In
this connection, the General Partner shall not invest in regulated investment
companies that elect to be subject to Part I of Subchapter M of the Code.


         SECTION 3.12.  Unrelated Business Taxable Income.

         (a)  The General Partner shall use its best efforts to cause the
Partnership to conduct its affairs in a manner that does not cause any Limited
Partner or partner of any Limited Partner exempt from income taxation pursuant
to Section 501 of the Code to have any "UNRELATED BUSINESS TAXABLE INCOME" (as
that term is defined in Section 512 of the Code).

         (b)  The obligation of the General Partner under subsection (a) shall
include, but shall not be limited to, the following:



                                     - 10 -


<PAGE>




             (1)
             The General Partner shall use best efforts to avoid taking any
             action which will cause any Limited Partner or partner of any
             Limited Partner to realize any taxable income from services
             performed;

             (2)
             The General Partner shall use best efforts to avoid causing any
             Limited Partner or partner of any Limited Partner to realize
             "unrelated debt-financed income" as that term is defined in Section
             514(a) of the Code; and

             (3)
             The General Partner shall not cause the Partnership to acquire an
             interest in another partnership, trust or non-corporate entity
             unless the General Partner determines that such proposed
             acquisition could not reasonably be expected to cause any Limited
             Partner or partner of any Limited Partner to realize any unrelated
             business taxable income.

         SECTION 3.13. ERISA Matters. The General Partner shall use its best
efforts to cause the Partnership to conduct its activities so that:

             (1)
             the Partnership will qualify at all times as a "VENTURE CAPITAL
             OPERATING COMPANY" as defined in the Plan Assets Regulations; and

             (2)
             the assets of the Partnership therefore do not constitute plan
             assets subject to the fiduciary standards of Part 4 of Title I of
             ERISA.

This Section 3.13 shall not have, or shall cease to have any force or effect if
the participation of "benefit plan investors [in the Partnership] is not
significant" within the meaning of the Plan Assets Regulations, or if such
Regulations are no longer in effect. In the event that the General Partner were
to be deemed a "FIDUCIARY" of any ERISA Limited Partner under Section 3(21) of
ERISA in a manner which would make Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the
Code applicable to the General Partner, then, in addition to whatever action it
may take or be required to take because it was such a fiduciary, the General
Partner will use best efforts to avoid the occurrence of any prohibited
transaction within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code.

         SECTION 3.14.  Borrowing and Guarantees.  Subject to Section 3.12, the
Partnership may engage in borrowing, but only on a short-term basis pending its
receipt of Additional Capital Contributions from the Partners. The Partnership
may guarantee the indebtedness of any



                                     - 11 -


<PAGE>



Portfolio Company; provided, however, that except with the consent of the
Advisory Committee, the total amount guaranteed by the Partnership at any one
time with respect to all Portfolio Companies shall not exceed 10% of the
aggregate Subscriptions of all Partners.



                                   ARTICLE IV

                                LIMITED PARTNERS

         SECTION 4.01. Names, Addresses and Subscriptions. The names and
addresses of the Limited Partners and their respective Subscriptions are set
forth in SCHEDULE A hereto. SCHEDULE A shall be amended from time to time to
reflect any change in the identity or Subscription of any Partner or the
aggregate Subscriptions of all Partners made in accordance with this Agreement,
and no such revision shall constitute an amendment of this Agreement.

         SECTION 4.02. Limited Liability. The liability of each of the Limited
Partners to the Partnership shall be limited to any unpaid capital contributions
which it agreed to make to the Partnership, except as otherwise provided under
the Delaware Act. The Partners acknowledge and agree that the Management Fee
shall be payable by the Partnership out of Partnership assets and will not be
paid directly by the Partners to the Management Company.

         SECTION 4.03.  No Control of Partnership; Other Limitations.

         (a)  No Limited Partner, in its capacity as such, shall take any part
in the control of the affairs of the Partnership, or undertake any transactions
on behalf of the Partnership, or have any power to sign for or to bind the
Partnership.

         (b)  No Limited Partner shall have the right or power to: (1) withdraw
or reduce its contribution to the capital of the Partnership except as a result
of the dissolution of the Partnership (provided that Limited Partners shall have
no right to withdraw or reduce their contributions on dissolution of the
Partnership to the extent that the Partnership requires funds to pay its
creditors) or as otherwise provided herein; (2) cause the termination and
dissolution of the Partnership, other than the right specified in Section 13.03;
or (3) demand or receive property other than cash in return for its contribution
except as otherwise provided herein.

         SECTION 4.04. Death, Dissolution or Bankruptcy. The death,
incompetence, bankruptcy, liquidation or dissolution of a Limited Partner shall
not result in the termination of the Partnership, but the rights of such Limited
Partner under this Agreement shall accrue to such Limited Partner's successor,
estate or legal representative. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement,
no other event affecting a limited partner (including but not limited to
insolvency) shall affect this Agreement.

                            EXPENSES; MANAGEMENT FEE

         SECTION 5.01. Organizational Expenses. Upon execution of this
Agreement, the Partnership shall reimburse the General Partner for all
reasonable expenses incurred by the General Partner and its Affiliates that are
attributable to the organization of the Partnership and the sale of interests in
the Partnership to the Limited Partners; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
organizational expenses of the Partnership and the Offshore Partnership shall
not exceed $500,000 in the aggregate. The General Partner shall allocate such
organizational expenses to the Partnership or the Offshore Partnership to the
extent such expenses can be reasonably attributed to one of such funds and not
the other. The remaining organizational expenses shall be allocated between the
Partnership and the Offshore Partnership in proportion to their respective total
Subscriptions. Any such expenses shall be paid by the Partnership and shall not
reduce the balance in any Partner's Contributions Account. Neither the
Partnership nor any Limited Partner shall be responsible for paying any
syndication, brokerage, placement or similar fee required to be paid to Merrill
Lynch & Co. on behalf of any Limited Partner. Such fees, if any, shall be paid
by the General Partner or an Affiliate thereof.

         SECTION 5.02. Management Fee. The Partnership shall pay semi-annually
in advance to the Management Company a Management Fee at the rate of (i) for the
period commencing on the date of the Initial Closing until the end of the
Commitment Period, 1.75% per year of the aggregate Subscriptions of all
Partners, and (ii) for the remainder of the term hereof, 1.75% per year of the
total Cost of Portfolio Company securities held by the Partnership at the end of
the immediately preceding fiscal year, subject, in each case, to the terms and
conditions of the Management Agreement.

         SECTION 5.03. Operating Expenses. The Management Company shall bear all
routine, normal operating expenses associated with the duties and services to be
rendered to the Partnership under the Management Agreement, as provided in the
Management Agreement. The Partnership shall reimburse the General Partner, upon
demand, for all reasonable expenses incurred by the General Partner in
discharging its responsibilities to the Partnership, and all other expenses of
the Partnership shall be borne by the Partnership.

                               ADVISORY COMMITTEE

         SECTION 6.01. Appointment and Vacancies. The Partnership and the
Offshore Partnership shall have the same advisory committee (to be formed after
the date of the Initial Closing) which shall consist of at least three members
and no more than five members appointed



                                     - 13 -


<PAGE>



by the General Partner and who shall be designees of the Limited Partners and
the limited partner of the Offshore Partnership (the "ADVISORY COMMITTEE"). The
General Partner may remove any member of the Advisory Committee at any time,
with or without cause, and may fill any vacancy resulting from any removal or
resignation from the Advisory Committee.

         SECTION 6.02. Meetings. The Advisory Committee shall meet at such times
and from time to time as the General Partner or a majority of the members of the
Advisory Committee may determine. The General Partner shall provide notice of
each meeting to the members of the Advisory Committee. Members of the Advisory
Committee shall receive from the Partnership and the Offshore Partnership
reimbursement for any expenses incurred, at the direction of the General
Partner, in connection with performing their duties hereunder, with any such
reimbursement to be borne by the Partnership and the Offshore Partnership pro
rata in proportion to their respective aggregate capital commitments.

         SECTION 6.03. Duties. To the extent permitted under Section 17-303 of
the Delaware Act for Persons that do not thereby become liable to any party as
general partners of the Partnership, the functions of the Advisory Committee
shall be to resolve potential conflicts of interest as outlined in Section 3.09,
to review and approve proposed Partnership investments to the extent required by
Section 3.11 and to review certain valuations of Partnership assets.

         SECTION 6.04. Voting; Rules and Procedures. All approvals,
disapprovals, vetoes and other actions taken by the Advisory Committee shall be
authorized by a majority of its members then holding office. The Advisory
Committee shall have the authority to adopt rules and procedures, not
inconsistent with this Agreement, relating to the conduct of its affairs.

         SECTION 6.05. Duty of Care. The members of the Advisory Committee shall
exercise their best judgment in carrying out their functions for the
Partnership. No member of the Advisory Committee shall be liable to the
Partnership or any Partner for any loss suffered by the Partnership or any
Partner which arises out of any action or omission of such member, provided that
(1) such member determined, in good faith, that such course of conduct was in,
or not opposed to, the best interest of the Partnership and, with respect to any
criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such Person's
conduct was unlawful, and (2) such course of conduct did not constitute gross
negligence or willful misconduct of such member. The Advisory Committee and each
member thereof shall be fully protected and justified with respect to any action
or omission taken or suffered by any of them in good faith if such action or
omission is taken or suffered in reliance upon and in accordance with the
opinion or advice as to matters of law of legal counsel, or as to matters of
accounting of accountants, or as to matters of valuation of investment bankers
or appraisers, selected by any of them with reasonable care. In addition, each
member of the Advisory Committee shall be entitled to indemnification by the
Partnership to the extent provided in Article XVIII hereof.

                           ADDITIONAL LIMITED PARTNERS

         SECTION 7.01. Additional Subscriptions Within 180 Days After Initial
Closing. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, during the period
commencing on the date of the Initial Closing until and through the date that is
180 days thereafter (the "FINAL CLOSING"), the General Partner is authorized,
but not obligated, to accept from time to time additional Subscriptions from the
Partners and to select and admit other Persons to the Partnership as additional
Limited Partners. Any such additional Subscriptions shall be accepted and any
such additional Limited Partners shall be admitted to the Partnership only if:
(a) such Partner or additional Limited Partner contributes or pays on or before
the date of its additional Subscription or admission, all amounts required by
Section 8.05 hereof; (b) no distribution has been made by the Partnership to the
Partners pursuant to Article XI prior to the date of such Partner's additional
Subscription or such additional Limited Partner's admission other than a
distribution described in Sections 8.05 and 11.06; and (c) after such admission
or the acceptance of such additional Subscriptions, the sum of the aggregate
Subscriptions of all Partners and the aggregate capital commitments of all
partners of the Offshore Partnership to the Offshore Partnership does not exceed
$250 million.

         SECTION 7.02. Accession to Agreement. Each Person who is to be admitted
as an additional or substitute Limited Partner pursuant to this Agreement shall
accede to this Agreement by executing, together with the General Partner, a
counterpart signature page to this Agreement providing for such admission, which
shall be deemed for all purposes to constitute an amendment to this Agreement
providing for such admission but shall not require the consent or approval of
any other Partner. In addition, the General Partner shall make any necessary
filings with the appropriate governmental authorities and take such actions as
are necessary under applicable law to effectuate such admission. The admission
of additional or substitute Limited Partners to the Partnership shall be
effective upon the execution of the necessary counterpart signature page to this
Agreement or such later effective date as is set forth in any instrument
executed by the General Partner and any newly-admitted Partner. The General
Partner shall cause SCHEDULE A to be amended from time to time, without the
consent of any other Partner, to reflect any changes in the Subscriptions or
identity of any Partner, the aggregate Subscriptions of all Partners including
any increase in the Subscription of the General Partner if accepted
contemporaneously with the acceptance of additional Subscriptions from the
Limited Partners, or the admission of Limited Partners.



                                  ARTICLE VIII

                           CAPITAL OF THE PARTNERSHIP


                                     - 15 -


<PAGE>



         SECTION 8.01.  Capital Contributions.

         (a)  The capital of the Partnership shall consist initially of the
initial capital contributions of the Partners, as set forth in SCHEDULE A, which
amount shall equal in the aggregate 10% of each Partner's Subscription.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the provisions of Section 3.13 apply to the
Partnership, the initial capital contribution of any ERISA Partner shall be
deferred until such time as such ERISA Partner is permitted to make such initial
capital contribution under ERISA (i.e., until the Partnership makes its first
investment in a portfolio company with respect to which the Partnership has
"management rights" as defined in the Plan Assets Regulations). In addition,
each Partner shall make additional contributions to the capital of the
Partnership ("ADDITIONAL CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS"), upon no less than 10 days'
prior written notice from the General Partner, so as to increase the aggregate
amount of its contributions to the Partnership to an amount equal to such
Partner's Subscription. Each such notice shall set forth the date on which the
related Additional Capital Contribution is due and shall include a general
description of the purposes and uses for which the Additional Capital
Contributions are being called including, for example, the payment of
Partnership expenses (including the Management Fee) and the purchase of
Portfolio Securities; provided that the General Partner shall not be required to
identify the purposes and uses of 100% of any Additional Capital Contribution or
be required to identify the name of any particular Portfolio Company or proposed
Portfolio Company. The amount of capital required to be contributed by each
Partner on each occasion of an Additional Capital Contribution shall be computed
by the General Partner so that each Partner's Additional Capital Contribution
bears the same relationship to the aggregate Additional Capital Contributions to
be made on such occasion as such Partner's Subscription bears to the aggregate
Subscriptions of all Partners. All calls for contributions of additional capital
by the Partners and the partners of the Offshore Partnership to their respective
partnerships shall be made on an as-needed basis at the same times and on
substantially the same terms. All capital contributions shall be made in cash in
United States dollars.

         (b)  From and after the end of the Commitment Period (as defined
below), the Limited Partners shall be released from any obligation to make
Additional Capital Contributions as provided for in Section 8.01(a) except to
the extent necessary to (i) pay the expenses and liabilities of the Partnership,
including the Management Fee, (ii) complete investments by the Partnership in
respect of transactions committed to by the Partnership prior to the end of the
Commitment Period and (iii) make follow-on investments in Portfolio Companies
provided that the aggregate amount of such follow-on investments shall not
exceed 20% of the aggregate Subscriptions of all Partners. The "COMMITMENT
PERIOD" shall commence on the date of the Initial Closing and shall end on the
fourth anniversary date of the Initial Closing; provided, that, if Robert L.
Burr and any one of Christopher M.V. Jones, Eytan M. Shapiro and Timothy R.V.
Parton are no longer active in the affairs of the Partnership and the General
Partner does not replace such Persons within 60 days thereafter with investment
manager(s) acceptable to a majority in interest of the Limited Partners, then
the Limited Partners, by vote of two-thirds in



                                     - 16 -


<PAGE>



interest of the Limited Partners taken within 45 days after the end of such 60
day period, may cause the Commitment Period to end prior to the fourth
anniversary of the date of the Initial Closing (provided that the limited
partner of the Offshore Partnership simultaneously causes the commitment period
of the Offshore Partnership to end).

         (c)  The General Partner may at any time, by written notice to the
Limited Partners, terminate in whole or in part the obligation of the Partners
to make Additional Capital Contributions and, upon the giving of such notice,
the obligation of the Partners to make such contributions shall terminate to the
extent specified in such notice. Any partial termination of the outstanding
obligations of the Partners to make Additional Capital Contributions shall be
accomplished by terminating in part the obligations of all Partners, pro rata in
proportion to their respective Subscriptions. The General Partner shall not
cause any termination of the Partners' obligation to make Additional Capital
Contributions unless a substantially equivalent termination occurs
contemporaneously with respect to the obligations of the partners of the
Offshore Partnership to make additional capital contributions to the Offshore
Partnership. In the event that the General Partner terminates, in whole or in
part, the obligations of the Partners to make Additional Capital Contributions,
each Partner's Subscription shall be reduced accordingly as of the date that
written notice of such termination is delivered to the Partners.

         SECTION 8.02.  Failure to Make Additional Capital Contributions.

         (a)  In the event that any Partner fails to pay any amount which it is
required to pay to the Partnership on or before the date when such amount is due
and payable, it shall be deemed to be in default hereunder (a "DEFAULTING
PARTNER") and a notice of default shall be given to it by express courier
service, facsimile transmission, air mail or certified or registered mail.

         (b)  If the full amount of such payment is not received by the
Partnership within 45 days after the delivery of such notice, as liquidated and
agreed upon current damages for such default (it being agreed that it would be
difficult or impossible to fix the actual damages), the Partnership shall have
the option, exercisable by the General Partner in its sole discretion by mailing
notice thereof to the Defaulting Partner, to reduce each of the Defaulting
Partner's Contributions Account and Capital Account established pursuant to
Sections 9.01 and 9.02, respectively, by an amount equal to 50% of such
Defaulting Partner's Subscription at the time of the default (the "DEFAULT
CHARGE"). The amount of any Default Charge levied upon a Defaulting Partner
shall immediately become unrestricted monies of the Partnership and shall be
allocated to and among the respective Contributions Accounts of the
non-defaulting Partners in such proportion as the Contributions Account of each
such non-defaulting Partner then bears to the sum of the Contributions Accounts
of all non-defaulting Partners; and to and among the respective Capital Accounts
of the non-defaulting Partners in such proportion as the Capital Account of each
such non-defaulting Partner then bears to the sum of the Capital Accounts of all
non-defaulting Partners. For purposes of the preceding sentence: (1) the amount
by which a Defaulting Partner's Contributions Account or Capital Account is
reduced shall in no case exceed



                                     - 17 -


<PAGE>



the positive balance in such Defaulting Partner's Contributions Account or
Capital Account, respectively, immediately before the reduction; (2) if either
of the Capital Account or the Contributions Account of the Defaulting Partner
otherwise would be reduced below zero by the imposition of the full amount of
any Default Charge, such account shall be reduced to zero and any excess of the
full amount of the Default Charge over the positive balance in such account
immediately before such reduction shall be carried over and applied to reduce
the balance in such account at such subsequent time or times as such account has
a positive balance; and (3) any increase in the Capital Accounts or
Contributions Accounts of non-defaulting Partners as the result of the
imposition of a Default Charge shall occur only at such time or times as the
corresponding reductions in the Defaulting Partner's accounts occur.

         (c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, (1) any Defaulting Partner that does not make full payment to the
Partnership of all amounts due and payable to the Partnership on or before the
date that is 45 days after notice of a default was mailed to such Partner as
provided in Section 8.02(a) shall not receive any distributions from the
Partnership until such time as the Partnership makes its final liquidating
distribution pursuant to Article XIV; and (2) any distributions that otherwise
would be made to a Defaulting Partner during such 45-day period shall be made to
such Defaulting Partner at the end of such 45-day period if, before the end of
such period, the Defaulting Partner has paid to the Partnership all amounts then
due and payable.

         (d)  The application of the aforesaid liquidated damages provision
shall not relieve any Defaulting Partner of such Partner's obligation to make
all subsequent Additional Capital Contributions when due unless the General
Partner, in its sole discretion, determines that no further Additional Capital
Contribution shall be accepted from the Defaulting Partner and notifies such
Defaulting Limited Partner in writing. As of the date that such notice is sent
to the Defaulting Partner, such Defaulting Partner's Subscription shall be
reduced by an amount equal to the excess of such Defaulting Partner's original
Subscription over the aggregate paid-in capital contributions of such Defaulting
Partner. In the event that the balances in each of the Capital Account and the
Contributions Account of any Defaulting Partner have been reduced to zero and
either (1) each Partner (other than any Defaulting Partner) has contributed to
the Partnership the full amount of such Partner's Subscription, or (2) the
General Partner has determined that such Defaulting Partner shall not be
permitted to make any subsequent Additional Capital Contribution to the
Partnership, such Defaulting Partner's interest in the Partnership shall be
extinguished completely and the Partnership shall have no further obligation of
any nature to such Person. Except as expressly set forth herein, no Partner may
contribute to the Partnership less than the full amount of such Partner's
Subscription.

         SECTION 8.03. No Interest or Withdrawals. No interest shall accrue on
any capital contribution made by a Partner, and no Partner shall have the right
to withdraw or to be repaid any of its capital contributions so made, except as
specifically provided in this Agreement.

         SECTION 8.04. Minimum Capital Contribution of the General Partner. The
General Partner shall contribute capital the Partnership at such times and in
such amounts as necessary to ensure that the paid-in capital contributions of
the General Partner are at all times equal in the aggregate to at least 1.01% of
the paid-in capital contributions of the Limited Partners at such times.

         SECTION 8.05. Contributions and Payments on Admission of Additional
                       Limited Partners

         (a)  Upon the admission of any additional Limited Partner in accordance
with Section 7.01 hereof: (i) the General Partner shall amend or supplement
Schedule A hereto to reflect the name, address and Subscription of such
additional Limited Partner; (ii) the Subscription of any such additional Limited
Partner shall be included thereafter in the Partnership's aggregate
Subscriptions; and (iii) the Subscription of the General Partner shall be
increased (if necessary) to the amount then required by Section 8.04.

         (b)  Each additional Limited Partner shall pay to the Partnership, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, on the date of its admission as a
Limited Partner the following amounts (which amounts in clause (ii) and (iii)
shall not constitute part of the Additional Capital Contributions of such
additional Limited Partner):

              (i)    a capital contribution representing the same percentage of
                     its Subscription as the percentage which each other Partner
                     has been required to contribute of its Subscription prior
                     to such date (treating, for this purpose, any amounts
                     previously returned to any Partner pursuant to Section
                     8.05(c)(i), and any amount required to be so returned upon
                     the admission of such additional Limited Partner, as if
                     such amounts had not been previously contributed by such
                     previously admitted Partner);

              (ii)   an amount equal to interest that would have been earned if
                     the dollar amount of such additional Limited Partner's
                     proportionate share of the capital contributions previously
                     used to make investments in Portfolio Companies (unless in
                     the discretion of the General Partner there has been a
                     material change or significant event relating to a
                     Portfolio Company which would justify a different amount),
                     had been invested at an interest rate equal to the Prime
                     Rate plus two percent (2%) per annum, compounded annually,
                     for the period from such investment to the date of such
                     additional Limited Partner's admission to the Partnership;
                     and


              (iii)  an additional amount equal to the interest that would have
                     been earned if the dollar amount of the additional payment
                     of the Management Fee made by the Partnership to the
                     Management Company at the time of the admission of such
                     additional Limited Partner

                     that is attributable to the Partnership's acceptance of
                     such Limited Partner's initial Subscription had been
                     invested at an interest rate equal to the Prime Rate per
                     annum, compounded annually, for the period from the Initial
                     Closing to the date of the admission of such additional
                     Limited Partner. The Partnership shall remit such
                     additional amounts to the Management Company as provided in
                     Section 5.02.

         (c)  Upon the admission of an additional Limited Partner, the
Partnership shall distribute to the Partners (other than any Limited Partners
admitted on such admission date):

              (i)    an amount equal to such additional Partner's proportionate
                     share of the capital contributions previously used to make
                     investment in Portfolio Companies, which shall be
                     apportioned among such previously admitted Limited
                     Partners, in proportion to their respective contributions
                     and shall increase on a dollar-for-dollar basis the
                     Additional Capital Contributions required to be made by
                     each Partner pursuant to Section 8.01 and correspondingly
                     decrease each such Partner's Contributions Account; and

              (ii)   an amount equal to the additional payment made by such
                     additional Limited Partner pursuant to Section 8.05(b)(ii),
                     which shall not increase the Additional Capital
                     Contributions required to be made by any Partner pursuant
                     to Section 8.01.

         (d)  Each Partner acknowledges and agrees that the intent of this
Section 8.05 is to allow such additional Limited Partner to obtain an indirect
interest (based on relative Subscriptions) in each investment in a Portfolio
Company previously made by the Partnership at the time such additional Limited
Partner makes such initial capital contribution and to cause each additional
Limited Partner to bear its proportionate additional share of the Management Fee
paid prior to the acceptance of such additional Limited Partners, in each case
in exchange for the payments required under this Section 8.05. Subject to the
foregoing, each additional Limited Partner shall be treated in all respects as
if it had been an original Limited Partner of the Partnership, and shall be
subject to all of the obligations of the Limited Partners hereunder including,
without limitation, the obligation to make all Additional Capital Contributions
required by Section 8.01.

         (e)  For purposes of the provisions of Sections 8.05(b)(ii) and
8.05(b)(iii), the acceptance of additional Subscriptions after the Initial
Closing from any existing Limited Partner that was originally admitted as a
Limited Partner prior to the Final Closing shall not be treated as an admission
of an additional Limited Partner if and to the extent that such additional
Subscription results from the original terms or formula by which such existing
Limited Partner's Subscription was calculated and is made in order to allow such
Limited Partner to maintain its relative Subscription as a percentage of the
aggregate Subscriptions of all Partners. Accordingly,



                                     - 20 -


<PAGE>



no such existing Limited Partner shall be required to make any additional
payments pursuant to clauses (ii) or (iii) of Section 8.05(b). Similarly, if the
initial capital contribution of any ERISA Partner is deferred pursuant to
Section 8.01, such ERISA Partner shall not be required to make any additional
payments pursuant to clauses (ii) or (iii) of Section 8.05(b) when it makes that
initial capital contribution, and no interest shall be paid by the Partnership
to the Management Company with respect to any resulting deferred payment of the
Management Fee. Any previously-admitted Limited Partner that (i) is not
described in either of the three preceding sentences and (ii) increases its
Subscription after the Initial Closing shall be treated as an additional Limited
Partner with respect to such increase only, for purposes of Sections 8.05(a) and
8.05(b).

         (f)  Solely for tax purposes, each Limited Partner that is not an
additional Limited Partner shall be deemed to have sold a proportionate part of
its interest in the Partnership to the additional Limited Partner for a purchase
price equal to the amount distributed to such Limited Partner pursuant to
Section 8.05(c) upon the admission of an additional Limited Partner.



                                   ARTICLE IX

                                    ACCOUNTS

         SECTION 9.01. Contributions Accounts. There shall be established on the
books of the Partnership a capital contributions account ("CONTRIBUTIONS
ACCOUNT") for each Partner which shall consist of such Partner's initial capital
contribution to the Partnership made pursuant to this Agreement, (a) increased
by (1) any Additional Capital Contributions made by such Partner, and (2) any
part of a Default Charge added to the Contributions Account of such Partner
pursuant to Section 8.02; and (b) decreased by (1) any Default Charge subtracted
from the Contributions Account of such Partner pursuant to Section 8.02 and (2)
any distributions pursuant to Section 8.05(c)(i). Except as provided in the
preceding sentence, a Partner's Contributions Account shall not be reduced on
account of any distributions of capital to such Partner or for any other reason.

         SECTION 9.02. Capital Accounts. There shall be established on the books
of the Partnership a capital account ("CAPITAL ACCOUNT") for each Partner that
shall consist of such Partner's initial capital contribution to the Partnership
made pursuant to this Agreement, (a) increased by (1) any Additional Capital
Contributions made by such Partner, (2) any part of a Default Charge added to
the Capital Account of such Partner pursuant to Section 8.02, and (3) any
amounts from time to time added to the Capital Account of such Partner pursuant
to Article X; (b) decreased by (1) any distributions made to such Partner
including pursuant to Section 8.05(c)(i), (2) any Default Charge subtracted from
the Capital Account of such Partner pursuant to Section 8.02, and (3) any
amounts subtracted from the Capital Account of such



                                     - 21 -


<PAGE>



Partner pursuant to Article X; and (c) otherwise adjusted in accordance with the
tax accounting principles set forth in Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv). For these purposes, Net Gain allocated to any Partner shall
be added to, and Net Loss and Loss Items so allocated shall be subtracted from,
such Partner's Capital Account.

         SECTION 9.03. Accounting for Distributions in Kind. For purposes of
maintaining Capital Accounts when Partnership property is distributed in kind,
(a) the Partnership shall treat such property as if it had been sold for its
fair market value on the date of distribution as determined in accordance with
Article XII; (b) any difference between the fair market value of such property
as so determined and the Cost of such property shall constitute Net Gain or Loss
attributable to such distribution and shall be allocated to the Capital Accounts
of the Partners pursuant to Article X; and (c) all property distributed in kind
by the Partnership to a Partner shall be debited to that Partner's Capital
Account at the fair market value of such property on the date of distribution
(net of any liabilities secured by such distributed property that such Partner
is considered to assume or take subject to under Section 752 of the Code).

         SECTION 9.04. Compliance With Treasury Regulations. The foregoing
provisions and the other provisions of this Agreement relating to the
maintenance of Capital Accounts are intended to comply with Section 704(b) of
the Code and Treasury Regulations Section 1.704- 1(b), and shall be interpreted
and applied in a manner consistent with such regulations. In the event that the
General Partner shall determine that it is prudent to modify the manner in which
the Capital Accounts, or any debits or credits thereto, are computed in order to
comply with such regulations, the General Partner may make such modification,
provided that it is not likely to have a material effect on the amounts
distributable to any Partner pursuant to Articles XI or XIV hereof.



                                    ARTICLE X

Partnership and after giving effect to the special allocations set forth in

fiscal year shall be allocated to the Capital Accounts of the Partners as

         (a)  First, to all Partners, in proportion to the amounts of Net Loss
(if any) previously allocated to each such Partner pursuant to Section 10.03(d)

Net Gain made pursuant to this Section 10.02(a), an amount of Net Gain equal to
the aggregate amount of such Net Loss;

         (b)  Second, to the extent of any Net Gain remaining after allocations
pursuant to Section 10.02(a), to all Partners, in proportion to each Partner's

aggregate amount of such 8% Preferential Return Allocations;

         (c)   Third, to the extent of any Net Gain remaining after allocations

                     (1)
                     if the Partnership is not in an 8% Payback Period, 100% to
                     all Partners in proportion to their respective
                     Contributions Accounts; and

                     (2)
                     if the Partnership is in an 8% Payback Period, 100% to the
                     General Partner until the General Partner has received
                     additional allocations of Net Gain pursuant to this Section
                     10.02(c)(2) and Sections 10.02(d) and 10.06 (net of
                     offsetting allocations of Net Loss and Loss Items) equal in
                     the aggregate to its 20% Subordinate Gain Allocation; and

         (d)  Fourth, to the extent of any Net Gain remaining after allocations
pursuant to Sections 10.02(a), 10.02(b) and 10.02(c), 80% to all Partners in

         SECTION 10.03. Net Loss. As of the end of each fiscal year of the

follows:

         (a)  First, to all Partners, in proportion to the respective amounts of
Net Gain (if any) previously allocated to each such Partner pursuant to Section
10.02(d) and not offset by prior allocations of Net Loss made pursuant to this
Section 10.03(a) or Loss Items pursuant to Section 10.05, an amount of Net Loss
equal to the aggregate amount of such Net Gain (if any).

         (b)  Second, to the extent of any Net Loss remaining after allocations
pursuant to Section 10.03(a):

                     (1)
                     to the General Partner, an amount of Net Loss equal to the
                     aggregate amount of Net Gain previously allocated to the
                     General Partner pursuant to



                                     - 23 -


<PAGE>



                     Section 10.02(c)(2) and not offset by prior allocations of
                     Net Loss made pursuant to this Section 10.03(b)(1) or Loss
                     Items pursuant to Section 10.05; and then

                     (2)
                     to all Partners, in proportion to the respective amounts of
                     Net Gain (if any) previously allocated to each Partner
                     pursuant to Section 10.02(c)(1) and not offset by prior
                     allocations of Net Loss made pursuant to this Section
                     10.03(b)(2) or Loss Items pursuant to Section 10.05, an
                     amount of Net Loss equal to the aggregate amount of such
                     Net Gain.

         (c)  Third, to the extent of any Net Loss remaining after allocations
pursuant to Sections 10.03(a) and 10.03(b), to all Partners, in proportion to
the respective amounts of Net Gain (if any) previously allocated to each Partner
pursuant to Section 10.02(b) and not offset by prior allocations of Net Loss
made pursuant to this Section 10.03(c) or Loss Items pursuant to Section 10.05,
an amount of Net Loss equal to the aggregate amount of such Net Gain.

         (d)  Fourth, to the extent of any Net Loss remaining after allocations
pursuant to Section 10.03(a), 10.03(b) and 10.03(c), to all Partners in
proportion to their respective Contributions Accounts.

         SECTION 10.04. Distributions in Kind. Net Gain or Loss attributable to
a distribution of Partnership property in kind shall be allocated, immediately
prior to the time such distribution is made, to the Partners' Capital Accounts
on the same basis as an equivalent amount of Net Gain or Loss would be allocated
for a hypothetical fiscal year ending immediately prior to such distribution.
For this purpose, there shall be taken into account any Net Gain or Loss
attributable to distributions in kind previously made during the fiscal year,
but there shall not be taken into account other items of Partnership income,
gain, loss or deduction realized or incurred since the end of the prior fiscal
year (such items being taken into account and allocated to Partners' Capital
Accounts as Net Gain, Net Loss or Loss Items only at the end of the fiscal year
in which they are realized or incurred).

         SECTION 10.05.  Operational Rules.

         (a)  If, for any fiscal period, Net Gain is available to be allocated
to the Partners but (1) an allocation of all of such Net Gain pursuant to
Section 10.02 for such fiscal period would not be sufficient to provide each
Partner with such Partner's full 8% Preferential Return Allocation for such
fiscal period, and (2) any allocation of Net Gain for any prior fiscal period
has been made pursuant to Sections 10.02(c)(2) or 10.02(d) but not previously
offset by allocations of Net Loss pursuant to Sections 10.03(a) or 10.03(b)(1)
or Loss Items pursuant to this Section 10.05, then:

<PAGE>



                     (A)
                     Loss Items for such fiscal period shall be allocated
                     (subject to the remainder of this Article X) to all
                     Partners, in proportion to the respective amounts of Net
                     Gain previously allocated to each such Partner pursuant to
                     Sections 10.02(c)(2) or 10.02(d) and not previously offset
                     by allocations of Net Loss made pursuant to Sections
                     10.03(a) or 10.03(b)(1) or Loss Items pursuant to this
                     Section 10.05, in an aggregate amount equal to the lesser
                     of the aggregate amount of such Loss Items or the aggregate
                     amount of such Net Gain, with such Loss Items allocated
                     among the Partners to offset such allocations of Net Gain
                     in the order in which such allocations of Net Gain
                     previously were made; and

                     (B)
                     the Net Gain of the Partnership for such fiscal period,
                     determined solely for this purpose by excluding all Loss
                     Items specially allocated pursuant to this Section 10.05
                     with respect to such fiscal period, shall then be allocated
                     pursuant to Section 10.02.

         (b)  If, for any fiscal period which is an 8% Payback Period, Net Gain
is available to be allocated to the Partners but (1) an allocation of all of
such Net Gain pursuant to Section 10.02 for such fiscal period would be
insufficient to provide the General Partner with its full 20% Subordinate Gain
Allocation, and (2) any allocation of Net Gain for any prior fiscal period has
been made pursuant to Section 10.02(d) but not previously offset by allocations
of Net Loss pursuant to Section 10.03(a) or Loss Items pursuant to this Section
10.05, then:

                     (A)
                     Loss Items for such fiscal period shall be allocated
                     (subject to the remainder of this Article X) to all
                     Partners, in proportion to the respective amounts of Net
                     Gain previously allocated to each such Partner pursuant to
                     Section 10.02(d) and not previously offset by allocations
                     of Net Loss made pursuant to Section 10.03(a) or Loss Items
                     pursuant to this Section 10.05, in an aggregate amount
                     equal to the lesser of the aggregate amount of such Loss
                     Items or the aggregate amount of such Net Gain, with such
                     Loss Items allocated among the Partners to offset such
                     allocations of Net Gain in the order in which such
                     allocations of Net Gain previously were made; and

                     (B)
                     the Net Gain of the Partnership for such fiscal period,
                     determined solely for this purpose by excluding all Loss
                     Items specially allocated pursuant to this Section 10.05
                     with respect to such fiscal period, shall then be allocated
                     pursuant to Section 10.02.

         SECTION 10.06. Regulatory Allocations. The following provisions are
included in order to comply with tax rules set forth in the Code and to permit
the Partnership to obtain the benefits of a "SAFE HARBOR" provided by Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d).

         (a)  If and to the extent that any allocation of Net Loss or Loss Items
(or portion thereof) to any Partner would cause such Partner's Capital Account
to be negative by an amount which exceeds such Partner's Restoration Amount then
such loss (or portion thereof) shall be allocated first to the Capital Accounts
of the other Partners in proportion to the positive balances in their respective
Capital Accounts until all such Capital Accounts are reduced to zero, then to
the Capital Accounts of Partners with Restoration Amounts, in proportion to
their respective Restoration Amounts, until each such Partner's Capital Account
is negative by an amount equal to such Partner's Restoration Amount, and then to
the Capital Account of the General Partner; provided that an allocation pursuant
to this Section 10.06(a) shall be made only if and to the extent that the
deficit in such Partner's Capital Account would exceed such Partner's
Restoration Amount after all allocations provided for in this Article X have
been made tentatively as if Section 10.06 hereof were not included in this
Agreement.

         (b)  If any Partner unexpectedly receives an adjustment, allocation or
distribution described in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4),
(5) or (6), and such adjustment, allocation or distribution causes such Partner
to have a deficit balance in such Partner's Capital Account that exceeds such
Partner's Restoration Amount or would further reduce a balance in such Partner's
Capital Account that is already negative by an amount which exceeds such
Partner's Restoration Amount, there shall be allocated to such Partner items of
income and gain (consisting of a pro rata portion of each item of Partnership
income, including gross income, and gain for such fiscal period) in an amount
and manner sufficient to eliminate such Partner's deficit Capital Account
balance, to the extent required by Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d), as quickly as possible, provided that an allocation
pursuant to this Section 10.06(b) shall be made only if and to the extent that
the deficit in such Partner's Capital Account would exceed such Partner's
Restoration Amount after all allocations provided for in this Article X have
been made tentatively as if this Section 10.06(b) were not included in this
Agreement. The foregoing sentence is intended to constitute a "QUALIFIED INCOME
OFFSET" provision as described in Treasury Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d), and shall be interpreted and applied in all respects in
accordance with that Section.

         (c)  In the event that any Partner has a negative Capital Account at
the end of any Partnership fiscal year which is in excess of such Partner's
Restoration Amount, there shall be allocated to such Partner items of
Partnership income (including gross income) and gain in the amount of such
excess as quickly as possible, provided that an allocation pursuant to this
Section 10.06(c) shall be made only if and to the extent that the deficit in
such Partner's Capital Account would exceed such Partner's Restoration Amount
after all allocations provided for in this Article X have been made tentatively
as if Section 10.06(b) hereof and this Section 10.06(c) were not included in
this Agreement.

         (d)  To the extent that an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any
Partnership asset pursuant to Section 743(b) of the Code is required, pursuant
to Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account
in determining Capital Accounts, the amount of such adjustment to the Capital
Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the
basis of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis) and such
gain or loss shall be specially allocated to the Partners in a manner consistent
with the manner in which their Capital Accounts are required to be adjusted
pursuant to such Section of the Treasury Regulations.

         (e)  The allocations set forth in Sections 10.06(a), 10.06(b), 10.06(c)
and 10.06(d) hereof (the "REGULATORY ALLOCATIONS") are intended to comply with
certain requirements of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b). Notwithstanding
any other provisions of this Article X (other than the Regulatory Allocations),
the Regulatory Allocations shall be taken into account in allocating subsequent
Net Gain, Net Loss, Loss Items and items of income, gain, loss and deduction
among the Partners so that, to the extent possible, the net amount of such
allocations of subsequent Net Gain, Net Loss, Loss Items and other items and the
Regulatory Allocations to each Partner shall be equal to the net amount that
would have been allocated to each such Partner pursuant to the provisions of
this Article X if the Regulatory Allocations had not occurred.

        For purposes of applying the foregoing sentence, allocations pursuant
to this Section 10.06(e) shall be made with respect to allocations pursuant to
Section 10.06(d) only to the extent the General Partner reasonably determines
that such allocations will otherwise be inconsistent with the economic agreement
among the Partners. Further, if allocations to the General Partner include or
are affected by Regulatory Allocations or allocations pursuant to this Section
10.06(e) intended to offset such Regulatory Allocations, the General Partner,
after consulting with the Partnership accountants and other advisors, shall have
discretion to make such adjustments to subsequent 20% Subordinate Gain
Allocations as the General Partner deems reasonably necessary or appropriate to
effectuate the economic arrangements of the Partners.

         (f)  Subject only to the "QUALIFIED INCOME OFFSET" provisions of
Section 10.06(b) hereof, the General Partner shall be allocated at least 1% of
each material item of Partnership income, gain, loss, deduction or credit at all
times during the existence of the Partnership. To the extent that any allocation
is made pursuant to this Section 10.06(f), such allocation shall be treated as a
Regulatory Allocation for purposes of Section 10.06(e); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
in the event of any conflict between Section 10.06(e) and this Section 10.06(f),
this Section 10.06(f) shall govern.

         SECTION 10.07.  Adjustments to Reflect Changes in Interests.

         (a)  Notwithstanding the foregoing but subject to Section 10.07(b),
with respect to any fiscal period during which any Partner's interest in the
Partnership changes, whether by reason of



                                     - 27 -


<PAGE>



the admission of a Partner, the withdrawal of a Partner, a non-pro rata
contribution of capital to the Partnership or any other event described in
Section 706(d)(1) of the Code and regulations issued thereunder, allocations of
Net Gain, Net Loss and Loss Items shall be adjusted appropriately to take into
account the varying interests of the Partners during such period. The General
Partner shall consult with the Partnership's accountants and other advisors and
shall select the method of making such adjustments, which method shall be used
consistently thereafter.

         (b)  If any Person is admitted to the Partnership (or the Subscription
of any existing Partner is increased) after the Initial Closing in accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement, the General Partner shall adjust the
allocations otherwise provided for in this Article X of Net Gain or Loss and
Loss Items (and items of Partnership income, gain, loss and expense), for the
fiscal year in which such event occurs and for subsequent fiscal years if
necessary, so that, after such adjustments have been made, each Partner
(including any Partners admitted after the Initial Closing and all Partners
whose Subscriptions have been increased after the Initial Closing) shall have
been allocated Partnership expenses, including Organizational Expenses, equal in
amount to the aggregate amount of Partnership expenses such Partner would have
been allocated if it had been admitted to the Partnership on the Initial Closing
with a Subscription equal to that set forth in SCHEDULE A after such schedule
has been amended to reflect such Partner's admission or the increase in its
Subscription; provided, however, that (1) no item of income, gain or deductible
loss realized (or deemed to have been realized on a distribution in kind) before
the admission of any new Partner shall be allocated to such Partner and (2)
allocations to any existing Partner of items of income, gain or deductible loss
realized (or deemed to have been realized on a distribution in kind) prior to
the increase in the Subscription of such Partner shall be limited to those
permitted by Section 706 of the Code.

         SECTION 10.08. Tax Allocations. For federal, state and local income tax
purposes, Partnership income, gain, loss, deduction or credit (or any item
thereof) for each fiscal year shall be allocated to and among the Partners in
order to reflect the allocations made pursuant to the provisions of this Article
X for such fiscal year (other than allocations of items which are not deductible
or are excluded from taxable income), taking into account any variation between
the adjusted tax basis and book value of Partnership property in accordance with
the principles of Section 704(c) of the Code.

         SECTION 10.09.  Timing of Allocations.

         (a)  The General Partner shall cause the Partnership to make the
allocations described in this Article X as of any time that the Partnership
enters an 8% Payback Period on the basis of an interim closing of the
Partnership's books at such time. It is intended that this Section 10.09, in
conjunction with Section 11.04(a) and the definition of 8% Preferential Return
Allocation set forth in APPENDIX A, shall be interpreted so as to apportion Net
Gain of the Partnership for the full fiscal period to be divided by such interim
closing to the short fiscal period prior to the



                                     - 28 -


<PAGE>



interim closing only to the extent necessary to provide each Partner with the
allocations of Net Gain contemplated by Sections 10.02(a) and 10.02(b), and that
all remaining Net Gain for such full fiscal period shall be deemed to be
attributable to the short fiscal period following such interim closing.

         (b)  The General Partner in its sole discretion may also cause the
Partnership to make such allocations on the basis of an interim closing of the
books as of the time that any distribution is made during a fiscal period that
is not an 8% Payback Period. In such event, it is intended that the pertinent
provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted so as to apportion Net Gain of
the Partnership for the full fiscal period to be divided by such interim closing
to the short fiscal period prior to the interim closing and the short fiscal
period following such interim closing in the manner determined by the General
Partner, after consultation with the Partnership's accountants and other
advisors, to be appropriate to effectuate the economic arrangements among the
Partners as contemplated by this Agreement.

         (c)  If any such interim closing occurs, each short fiscal period that
results shall constitute a fiscal year for purposes of this Article X other than
Section 10.08 hereof. Tax allocations pursuant to Section 10.08 shall be made
only as of the end of each fiscal year.



                                   ARTICLE XI

                                  DISTRIBUTIONS

         SECTION 11.01.  Tax Distributions.

         (a)  The Partnership shall distribute to each Partner (including any
tax-exempt Partners) in cash, with respect to each fiscal year, either during
such year or within 90 days thereafter, an amount equal to the aggregate state
and federal income tax liability such Partner would have incurred as a result of
such Partner's ownership of an interest in the Partnership, calculated (i) as if
such Partner were (A) subject to tax as a resident or domiciliary of New York
City, New York and (B) taxable at the maximum rates provided for with respect to
natural persons (or, if higher, with respect to taxable corporations) under
applicable federal, state and local income tax laws as determined from time to
time by the General Partner after consulting with accountants to the
Partnership; (ii) as if allocations from the Partnership were, for such year,
the sole source of income and loss for such Partner; and (iii) without regard to
the carryover of items of loss, deduction and expense previously allocated by
the Partnership to such Partner (such distributions being referred to herein as
"TAX DISTRIBUTIONS").

         (b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing:  (1) the aggregate amount of Tax
Distributions that otherwise would be made pursuant to this Section 11.01 may be
reduced or not made with respect to any fiscal year to the extent determined by
the General Partner in its sole discretion,



                                     - 29 -


<PAGE>



and (2) Tax Distributions that otherwise would be made to any Partner with
respect to any Fiscal Year pursuant to Section 11.01(a) shall be reduced by the
amount of any other cash distributions made by the Partnership to such Partner
during such Fiscal Year or within 90 days thereafter, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
for purposes of this clause (2) any Tax Distribution made within 90 days after
the beginning of any fiscal year with respect to a prior year shall not be
accounted for as a Tax Distribution for the fiscal year in which it was made.

         (c)  The Partnership may make Tax Distributions to the Partners during
any Partnership fiscal year to enable them to satisfy their liability to make
estimated tax payments with respect to such fiscal year or the preceding fiscal
year based on calculations of the Partners' estimated tax liability made
pursuant to Section 11.01(a) as of such dates as the General Partner in its sole
discretion may determine; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that:

                     (1)
                     if the aggregate amount of Tax Distributions made to the
                     General Partner with respect to any fiscal year exceeds the
                     tax liability of the General Partner with respect to such
                     fiscal year (calculated as of the end of such fiscal year
                     pursuant to Section 11.01(a)), such excess shall be treated
                     to the maximum extent possible as an advance to the General
                     Partner against the General Partner's distributive share of
                     Partnership income and the General Partner shall return
                     such excess to the Partnership without interest promptly
                     after the determination of such excess amount; and

                     (2)
                     the Capital Account of the General Partner shall not be
                     reduced by any advances made to the General Partner
                     pursuant to this Section 11.01(c) during any fiscal year,
                     but shall be reduced as of the end of such fiscal year by
                     an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all such
                     advances (net of any part of such advances returned to the
                     Partnership by the General Partner pursuant to the
                     preceding clause (1)).

         SECTION 11.02. Timing of Distributions. The Partnership shall
distribute (a) the cash proceeds of all dispositions of Portfolio Securities and
(b) all other current income, in each case net of Partnership expenses and
reserves for reasonably-estimated future expenses and liabilities at such times
as the General Partner shall determine in its sole discretion and in any case
not later than 60 days after receipt of such cash proceeds or other current
income. The Partners acknowledge that it is the General Partner's intention to
make all distributions in cash during the term of the Partnership EXCEPT when
the General Partner has determined in good faith that a distribution of
Portfolio Securities in kind, made in accordance with the provisions of this
Article XI, would yield greater value to the Limited Partners at the time of
distribution than a sale of such Portfolio Securities by the Partnership and a
subsequent distribution of the proceeds thereof to the Limited Partners in cash.

         SECTION 11.03.  Priority of Distributions.

         (a)  Distributions of cash and Partnership property in kind (other than
Tax Distributions and Liquidating Distributions) made at any time while the
Partnership is not in an 8% Payback Period shall be made 100% to all Partners as
follows:

                     (1)
                     First, in proportion to their respective Contributions
                     Accounts until each Partner has received aggregate
                     distributions, in cash or in kind, equal to the balance in
                     such Partner's Contributions Account; and

                     (2)
                     Thereafter, in proportion to their respective 8%
                     Distribution Preferences.

         (b)  Distributions of cash and Partnership property in kind (other than
Tax Distributions and Liquidating Distributions) made at any time while the
Partnership is in an 8% Payback Period shall be made in the following order and
priority:


                     (1)
                     First, 100% to the General Partner until the General
                     Partner has received additional distributions equal to 20%
                     of the sum of (i) the excess of the Partnership's aggregate
                     prior distributions (including distributions made pursuant
                     to Section 11.03(a) on the date that the amount of a
                     distribution to be made pursuant to this Section
                     11.03(b)(1) is being determined over the aggregate balances
                     in the Contributions Accounts of all Partners and (ii) the
                     amount determined pursuant to the preceding clause (i)
                     multiplied by 25% (20/80); and


                     (2)
                     Second, as long as the Partnership continues to be in an 8%
                     Payback Period, 80% to all Partners in proportion to their
                     respective Contributions Accounts and 20% to the General
                     Partner.

         SECTION 11.04.  Operational Rules.

         (a)  If a proposed distribution of cash or of Partnership property in
kind made in accordance with the percentages specified in Section 11.03(a) would
cause the Partnership to enter an 8% Payback Period, such cash or property shall
be deemed to be divided into two parts, a "PRE-8% PAYBACK DISTRIBUTION"
consisting of that amount of such distribution which would



                                     - 31 -


<PAGE>



cause the Partnership to enter an 8% Payback Period if distributed in accordance
with Section 11.03(a) and a "POST-8% PAYBACK DISTRIBUTION" consisting of the
balance of such distribution; the Partnership's actual distribution of such
property shall be apportioned among the Partners accordingly.

         (b)  Proposed distributions pursuant to Section 11.03(b) that would
cause aggregate distributions to the General Partner to exceed the amounts
described in Section 11.03(b)(1) shall be divided in a manner similar to that
provided for under Section 11.04(a).

         (c)  Liquidating Distributions that cause the Partnership to enter into
an 8% Payback Period shall be deemed to be divided in a manner similar to that
provided for under Section 11.04(a) for purposes of Section 10.09 and any other
pertinent provision of this Agreement.

         (d)  All distributions other than Liquidating Distributions shall be
made in cash or in Freely Tradeable Securities unless otherwise approved by the
Advisory Committee. The valuation of securities distributed in kind shall be
made in the manner provided in Article XII. Each class of securities to be
distributed in kind shall be distributed to the Partners in proportion to their
respective shares of the proposed distribution as provided in Section 11.03,
except to the extent that a disproportionate distribution of such securities is
necessary in order to avoid distributing fractional shares. For purposes of the
preceding sentence, each lot of stock or other securities having a separately
identifiable tax basis or holding period shall be treated as a separate class of
securities.

         SECTION 11.05. Tax Withholding. If the Partnership incurs a tax
withholding obligation with respect to any Partner, any amount required to be
withheld by the Partnership with respect to such Partner shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as if it had been transferred to such Partner by
the Partnership as an interest-free advance. Amounts treated as advanced to any
Partner pursuant to this Section 11.05 shall be repaid by such Partner to the
Partnership within 30 days after the Partnership delivers a written request to
such Partner for such repayment; provided, however, that if any such repayment
is not made, the Partnership, at the discretion of the General Partner, shall
(a) collect such unpaid amounts from any Partnership distributions that
otherwise would be made to such Partner and/or (b) subtract from the Capital
Account of such Partner, no later than the day prior to the Partnership's first
liquidating distribution, the amount of any such tax withholding not so
collected, in each case treating the amount so collected or subtracted as having
been distributed to such Partner at the time of such collection or subtraction.
For purposes of this Section 11.05, any tax withholding obligation incurred by
the General Partner with respect to any Partner shall constitute a Partnership
obligation.

         SECTION 11.06.  Distributions on Admission of Additional Partners.
Upon the admission of a new Partner or an increase in the Subscription of any
existing Partner pursuant to



                                     - 32 -


<PAGE>



Section 7.01, the General Partner may, but shall not be obligated to, cause the
Partnership to distribute prior to such admission or increase in aggregate
Subscriptions, to the Persons who were Partners prior to such admission or
increase in aggregate Subscriptions and in proportion to such Partners'
respective Contributions Accounts as of the time immediately prior to such
admission or increase in Subscriptions, part or all of any amounts earned by the
Partnership on such Partners' paid-in capital contributions before such
contributions were invested in Portfolio Securities.

         SECTION 11.07.  Certain Distributions Prohibited.  Anything in this
Article XI to the contrary notwithstanding, all Partnership distributions shall
be subject to the following limitations.

         (a)  No distribution shall be made to any Partner if, and to the extent
that, such distribution would not be permitted under Section 17-607(a) of the
Delaware Act.

         (b)  No distribution other than a Tax Distribution shall be made to any
Partner to the extent that such distribution, if made, would cause the deficit
balance, if any, in the Capital Account of such Partner (determined without
regard to any allocations made pursuant to Section 10.06(b) and 10.06(c)) to
exceed such Partner's Restoration Amount.

         SECTION 11.08. Consent to Distributions. Each Partner, by becoming a
Partner, consents to any such distribution hereafter made or omitted to be made
to the Partners or any of them in accordance with this Article XI.



                                   ARTICLE XII

                         VALUATION OF PARTNERSHIP ASSETS

         SECTION 12.01. Valuation by General Partner. Whenever valuation of
Partnership assets or net assets is required by this Agreement, the General
Partner shall determine the fair market value thereof in good faith in
accordance with this Article XII. In the event of a distribution of securities
which are not Freely Tradeable Securities, the General Partner shall also
consult with the Advisory Committee with respect to the determination of the
fair market value of such securities.

         SECTION 12.02. Fair Market Value. The fair market value of any security
owned by the Partnership which is a Freely Tradeable Security (as defined in
Section 12.03) shall be determined as of the close of trading on the date as of
which the value is being determined by taking the last reported trade price of
such security on such trading date on the exchange where it is primarily traded
or, if such security is not traded on an exchange, such security shall be valued
at the last reported sale price on such date on the Nasdaq National Market
maintained by the



                                     - 33 -


<PAGE>



United States National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or, if such
security is not reported on the Nasdaq National Market, such security shall be
valued at the reported closing bid price (or average of bid prices) last quoted
on such date as reported by an established quotation service for
over-the-counter securities. The determination of the fair market value of all
other assets of the Partnership shall be based upon all relevant factors,
including, without limitation, such of the following factors as may be deemed
relevant by the General Partner: current financial position and current and
historic operating results of the issuer; sales prices of recent public or
private transactions in the same or similar securities, including transactions
on any securities exchange on which such securities are listed or in the
over-the-counter market; general level of interest rates; recent trading volume
of the security and other considerations affecting market liquidity;
restrictions on transfer, including the Partnership's right, if any, to require
registration of its securities by the issuer under the securities laws;
significant recent events affecting the issuer, including any pending private
placement, public offering, merger or acquisition; the price paid by the
Partnership to acquire the asset; the percentage of the issuer's outstanding
securities that is owned by the Partnership; and all other factors affecting
value.

         In making any such determination of the fair market value of the assets
of the Partnership, no allowance of any kind shall be made for goodwill or the
name of the Partnership or of the General Partner, the Partnership's office
records, files and statistical data or any intangible assets of the Partnership.

         SECTION 12.03. Freely Tradeable Securities. For purposes of this
Agreement a security shall be deemed to be a "FREELY TRADEABLE SECURITY" if (a)
the Partnership's entire holding of such securities can be sold by the
Partnership to the general public (including a sale by any Partner of the entire
distributed amount of its holdings following a distribution of such security
from the Partnership even though a sale by the Partnership of such securities,
if not so distributed to the Partners but sold by the Partnership to the general
public, might otherwise be restricted by volume limitations) and such sale can
be effected pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act or otherwise without the
necessity of any United States federal, state or local government registration
or consent (other than any ministerial notice filings of the type required
pursuant to Rule 144(h)), and (b) such securities are traded in a Public
Securities Market and market quotations are available for such securities,
including quotations available from market makers or specialists. If only a
portion of the Partnership's holdings of a class of securities satisfies the
requirements of the preceding sentence, that portion of such class shall
constitute Freely Tradeable Securities (so that, for example, any Partner can
sell the entire distributed amount of its holdings in such security following a
distribution of such security from the Partnership).

         SECTION 12.04.  Goodwill.  The Partnership's name and goodwill shall,
as among the Partners, be deemed to have no value and shall belong to the
Partnership, and no Partner shall have any right or claim individually to the
use thereof. Upon termination of the Partnership, the



                                     - 34 -

right to the name of the Partnership and any goodwill associated with the
Partnership's name shall be assigned to the General Partner.

                           DURATION OF THE PARTNERSHIP

         SECTION 13.01. Term of Partnership. The Partnership shall continue
until the date that is eight years after the Initial Closing unless its term is
extended as provided in Section 13.04, or unless it is sooner dissolved as
provided in Sections 13.02 or 13.03 or by operation of law.

         SECTION 13.02. Dissolution Upon Withdrawal of General Partner. The
Partnership shall be dissolved 90 days after the occurrence with respect to the
General Partner of any of the events of withdrawal described in Sections
17-402(a)(2) through 17-402(a)(10) of the Delaware Act unless all of the Limited
Partners agree within such 90-day period to continue the Partnership and
appoint, effective as of the date of withdrawal, a new General Partner. If the
General Partner suffers an event that, with the passage of the period specified
in the Delaware Act, becomes an event of withdrawal under Section 17-402(a)(4)
or (5) of the Delaware Act, the General Partner shall notify each Limited
Partner of the occurrence of such event within 30 days after the occurrence of
such event. The Partnership shall not be dissolved in the event of the

admission of any Limited Partner.

         SECTION 13.03. Dissolution by Partners. (a) The General Partner, with

such dissolution to the other Partners; provided that the general partners of
the Offshore Partnership, with the consent of the limited partner of the
Offshore Partnership, simultaneously dissolve the Offshore Partnership.

         (b) The Limited Partners, by vote of two-thirds in interest of the
Limited Partners taken within 45 days after the occurrence of any event giving
rise to such right, may dissolve the Partnership (provided that the Offshore
Partnership is simultaneously dissolved) if: (i) the General Partner commits a
material breach of any of its material obligations under this Agreement and such
breach continues to exist for 60 days after delivery of notice to the General
Partner of the occurrence of such breach or after the General Partner becomes
aware of such breach; or (ii) the General Partner, any partner of the General
Partner or a member of the General Partner's general partner is charged or
convicted of a felony in connection with the business of the Partnership.

         SECTION 13.04. Extension of Term. It is contemplated by the Partners
that the term of the Partnership shall terminate on the date that is eight years
after the Initial Closing and that the Partnership shall be considered to be
dissolved on such date without any further action being required by any of the
Partners, unless sooner terminated pursuant to Sections 13.02 or 13.03 or by
operation of law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term of the Partnership may
be extended for two additional one-year periods by the General Partner with the
prior approval of the Advisory Committee. The General Partner shall notify the
Limited Partners promptly of any such extension.



                                   ARTICLE XIV

                      LIQUIDATION OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS

         SECTION 14.01. General Provisions. At dissolution, the Partnership's
assets shall be liquidated in an orderly manner. The General Partner shall be
the liquidator to wind up the affairs of the Partnership pursuant to this
Agreement; provided that, if there shall be no remaining General Partner at that
time, a majority in interest of the Limited Partners may designate one or more
other Persons to act as the liquidator(s) instead of the General Partner. Any
such liquidator(s), other than the General Partner, shall be a "liquidating
trustee" within the meaning of Section 17-101(8) of the Delaware Act.

         SECTION 14.02. Liquidating Distributions. The liquidator(s) shall pay
or provide for the satisfaction of the Partnership's liabilities and obligations
to creditors. Any Net Gain or Loss realized in connection with the liquidation
of the Partnership shall be allocated among the Partners pursuant to Article X,
and the remaining assets of the Partnership shall then be distributed to the
Partners in cash (to the extent feasible) in proportion to the positive balances
in the respective Capital Accounts of the Partners (and, if a distribution in
kind is necessary, after allocating any Net Gain or Loss attributable to such
distribution). In performing their duties, the liquidator(s) are authorized to
sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of the assets of the Partnership in such
reasonable manner as the liquidator(s) shall determine to be in the best
interest of the Partners. During the liquidation of the Partnership, the
liquidator(s) shall furnish to the Partners the financial statements and other
information specified in Article XIX.

         SECTION 14.03. Expenses of Liquidator(s). The reasonable expenses
incurred by the liquidator(s) in connection with winding up the Partnership, all
other losses or liabilities of the Partnership incurred in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, and reasonable compensation for the services of the
liquidator(s) (which, with respect to any liquidator who is a General Partner,
shall be paid only if the Management Agreement is no longer in effect, and in
that event shall be in an amount determined in accordance with Section 3.06)
shall be borne by the Partnership. Subject to the terms of the Management
Agreement, and provided such agreement shall not have been terminated, and
provided further, that a majority in interest of the



                                     - 36 -


<PAGE>



Limited Partners have not designated another liquidator pursuant to Section
14.01, the Management Fee shall be continued for a period of one year from the
date of dissolution or until the liquidation is completed, whichever is sooner,
to permit the Management Company to assist in the liquidation.

         SECTION 14.04. Duration of Liquidation. A reasonable time shall be
allowed for the winding up of the affairs of the Partnership in order to
minimize any losses otherwise attendant upon such a winding up. The
liquidator(s) shall use its best efforts to dispose of or distribute all
Partnership assets within one year of dissolution, but shall not be bound to do
so or liable in any way to any Partner for failure to do so. The liquidator(s)
shall then make final liquidating distributions from the Partnership before the
later of (i) the end of the taxable year in which the date of liquidation of the
Partnership occurs, or (ii) 90 days after the date of the liquidation of the
Partnership. For this purpose, (x) the date of the liquidation of the
Partnership shall be the date on which the Partnership has ceased to be a going
concern, and (y) the Partnership shall not be deemed to have ceased to be a
going concern until it has sold, distributed or otherwise disposed of its
Portfolio Securities.

         SECTION 14.05. Duty of Care. The liquidator(s) shall not be liable to
the Partnership or any Partner for any loss attributable to any act or omission
of the liquidator(s) taken in good faith in connection with the liquidation of
the Partnership and distribution of its assets in belief that such course of
conduct was in the best interest of the Partnership. The liquidator(s) may
consult with counsel, accountants, investment bankers and appraisers with
respect to liquidating the Partnership and distributing its assets and shall be
justified in acting or omitting to act in accordance with the advice or opinion
of such counsel, accountants, investment bankers and appraisers, provided they
shall have been selected and retained with reasonable care.

         SECTION 14.06. No Liability for Return of Capital. The liquidator(s),
the General Partner and their respective officers, directors, agents, partners
(including the officers, directors, members, managers, employees and agents of
the partners of the General Partner) and their Affiliates shall not be
personally liable for the return of the capital contributions of any Partner to
the Partnership. No Partner shall be obligated to restore to the Partnership any
amount with respect to a negative Capital Account; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that this
provision shall not affect the obligations of Partners to make their agreed upon
capital contributions to the Partnership.

         SECTION 14.07  The General Partner's Obligation to Restore Deficit.
Upon completion of the liquidation of the Partnership, the General Partner shall
repay to the Partnership an amount equal to the deficit (if any) in the Capital
Account of the General Partner; provided, however, that the total amount which
the General Partner shall be obligated to return to the Partnership pursuant to
this Section 14.07 shall not exceed the aggregate amount of distributions
received by the General Partner from the Partnership reduced by the sum of (i)
the aggregate amount of distributions that the General Partner would have
received if each Partnership distribution had been made to all Partners in
proportion to the balances in their



                                     - 37 -


<PAGE>



respective Contributions Accounts, and (ii) the aggregate amount of Tax
Distributions made to the General Partner as of the date of determination (to
the extent not taken into account under the proceeding clause (i)). The General
Partner shall satisfy its repayment obligation by delivering to the Partnership
either cash or securities previously distributed to the General Partner by the
Partnership, valued in accordance with Article XII as of the date such repayment
is made. Any such repayment shall be made before the later of (1) the end of the
taxable year in which the date of liquidation of the Partnership occurs, or (2)
90 days after the date of the liquidation of the Partnership. For this purpose,
(A) the date of the liquidation of the Partnership shall be the date on which
the Partnership has ceased to be a going concern, and (B) the Partnership shall
not be deemed to have ceased to be a going concern until it has sold,
distributed or otherwise disposed of its Portfolio Securities. The intent of
this Section 14.07, in conjunction with the definition of "Restoration Amount,"
is to require the General Partner to return to the Partnership any distributions
(other than Tax Distributions) made to the General Partner with respect to its
20% "carried interest" to the extent that such distributions exceed in the
aggregate 20% of the excess of the Net Gain of the Partnership from its
inception through and including the date of the Partnership's final liquidating
distribution over the Net Loss of the Partnership over that period, and these
provisions shall be interpreted and applied accordingly. Amounts returned by the
General Partner to the Partnership shall be paid to creditors of the Partnership
(provided that no creditor of the Partnership shall have the right to enforce
any obligation of the General Partner to make the repayments contemplated by
this Section 14.07) or distributed to the Limited Partners in accordance with
the positive balances in their respective Capital Accounts.



                                   ARTICLE XV

            LIMITATION ON TRANSFERS OF INTERESTS OF LIMITED PARTNERS

         SECTION 15.01.  Consent of General Partner to Transfers.

         (a)  The prior written consent of the General Partner (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for any
Transfer of part or all of any Limited Partner's economic interest in the
Partnership. Any transferee of an economic interest in the Partnership shall
become a substituted Limited Partner only upon satisfaction of the requirements
set forth in Section 15.04.

         (b)  The following provisions are included in this Agreement to prevent
the Partnership from being classified as a "PUBLICLY TRADED PARTNERSHIP," as
defined in Section 7704 of the Code, that is taxable at the entity level:



                                     - 38 -


<PAGE>



                     (i)
                     The General Partner shall not cause or permit (x) any
                     offering of Partnership interests to be registered under
                     the Securities Act, or (y) interests in the Partnership to
                     become "traded on an established securities market," and
                     shall withhold its consent to any Transfer that, to the
                     General Partner's knowledge after reasonable inquiry, would
                     otherwise be accomplished by a trade on a "secondary market
                     or the substantial equivalent thereof," in each case within
                     the meaning of Sections 7704 or 469(i) of the Code and any
                     regulations promulgated thereunder that are in effect at
                     the time of the proposed Transfer;

                     (ii)
                     No Transfer of any Partnership interest or portion thereof
                     shall be permitted or recognized (within the meaning of
                     Treasury Regulation Section 1.7704-1(d)) by the Partnership
                     or the General Partner if and to the extent that such
                     Transfer, if made, would (x) fail to qualify as a "transfer
                     not involving trading" pursuant to Treasury Regulation
                     Section 1.7704-1(e), AND (y) cause the Partnership to fail
                     to qualify for the safe harbor for "private placements" set
                     forth in Section 1.7704-1(h), AND (z) cause the Partnership
                     to fail to qualify for the "lack of actual trading" safe
                     harbor set forth in Section 1.7704-1(h), unless the General
                     Partner determines that such Transfer would not otherwise
                     cause the Partnership to be treated as a publicly traded
                     partnership under Section 7704(b) of the Code; and


                     (iii)
                     The transferor and transferee shall provide the General
                     Partner, in connection with any proposed Transfer, written
                     representations to the effect that (A) the proposed
                     Transfer will not be effected on or through (1) a United
                     States national, regional or local securities exchange, (2)
                     a foreign securities exchange or (3) an interdealer
                     quotation system that regularly disseminates firm buy or
                     sell quotations by identified brokers or dealers
                     (including, without limitation, the Nasdaq Automated
                     Quotation System), (B) such Person is not, and its proposed
                     Transfer or acquisition (as the case may be) will not be
                     made by, through or on behalf of, (1) a Person, such as a
                     broker or a dealer, making a market in interests in the
                     Partnership, or (2) a Person who makes available to the
                     public bid or offer quotes with respect to interests in the
                     Partnership; and shall provide such additional written
                     representations as the General Partner reasonably may
                     request to enable it to comply with the preceding clause
                     (iii) (PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the General Partner may
                     waive its right to obtain such representations), and the
                     General Partner and counsel to the Partnership shall be
                     permitted to rely upon such representations and on written
                     representations from other Partners made prior to or
                     contemporaneously with such proposed Transfer.

         SECTION 15.02.  Opinion of Counsel.  Any Transfer shall be made only
upon receipt by the Partnership of a written opinion of counsel for the
Partnership or of other counsel



                                     - 39 -


<PAGE>



reasonably satisfactory to the Partnership (which opinion shall be obtained at
the expense of the transferor or through a charge to the transferor's Capital
Account) that such Transfer will not result in (A) the Partnership or the
General Partner being subjected to any additional regulatory requirements
(including those imposed by ERISA, the United States Investment Company Act of
1940, or the United States Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended), (B) a
violation of applicable law or this Agreement, (C) the Partnership being
classified as an association taxable as a corporation, (D) the Partnership being
treated as a corporation pursuant to Section 7704 of the Code, or (E) the
Partnership being deemed terminated pursuant to Section 708 of the Code. In
accordance with Section 21.10, such opinion shall also state that the interest
being transferred has been registered under the Securities Act or that an
exemption from such registration is available.

         SECTION 15.03. Expenses. The transferor of any interest in the
Partnership hereby agrees to reimburse the Partnership, at the request of the
General Partner, for any expenses reasonably incurred by the Partnership in the
course of consummating such Transfer, including any legal, accounting and other
expenses.

         SECTION 15.04. Substituted Limited Partners. Any transferee of a
Partnership interest transferred in accordance with the provisions of this
Article XV shall be admitted as a substituted Limited Partner upon the receipt
of the General Partner's written consent thereto (which may be withheld for any
reason or for no reason). Without the aforesaid consent of the General Partner
and the aforesaid written opinion of counsel, no transferee of a Partnership
interest shall be admitted as a substituted Limited Partner. The transferee of
an interest in the Partnership transferred pursuant to this Article XV that is
admitted to the Partnership as a substituted Limited Partner shall succeed to
the rights and liabilities of the transferor Limited Partner, and to the
Subscription, Contributions Account and Capital Account of the transferor, and
such Subscription, Contributions Account and Capital Account shall become the
Subscription, Contributions Account and Capital Account, respectively, of the
transferee, to the extent of the interest transferred.

         SECTION 15.05.  Covenants of Limited Partners.

         (a)  Each Limited Partner agrees with all other Partners that it will
not make any Transfer of all or any part of its interest in the Partnership
except in accordance with the provisions of this Article XV.

         (b)  Each Limited Partner, by its execution of this Agreement, agrees
and consents to the admission of any substituted Limited Partner pursuant to the
terms of this Article XV. Any transferee of a Partnership interest shall execute
a power-of-attorney as provided in Section 21.02 and such other documents as the
General Partner may request to effect such disposition, including an assumption
of all obligations of the transferor Limited Partner under this Agreement. Any
attempted Transfer of a Limited Partner's interest without compliance with this



                                     - 40 -


<PAGE>



Agreement shall be void. In the event of any transfer which shall result in
multiple ownership of any Limited Partner's interest in the Partnership, the
General Partner may require one or more trustees or nominees to be designated as
representing a portion of or the entire interest transferred for the purpose of
receiving all notices which may be given, and all payments which may be made,
under this Agreement and for the purpose of exercising all rights which the
transferor as a Limited Partner has pursuant to the provisions of this
Agreement. Every Transfer shall be subject to all of the terms, conditions,
restrictions and obligations of this Agreement.



                                   ARTICLE XVI

                       WITHDRAWAL OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS

         SECTION 16.01. Withdrawal of Partnership Interests. No Partner shall
have the right to withdraw its capital and profits from the Partnership, except
as provided below with respect to ERISA and PERISA withdrawal.

         SECTION 16.02. ERISA Partner Withdrawal. Notwithstanding any provision
in this Agreement to the contrary, any Limited Partner which is an ERISA Partner
may elect, upon written notice of such election to the General Partner, to
withdraw from the Partnership, or upon written demand by the General Partner
shall withdraw from the Partnership, at the time and in the manner hereinafter
provided, if either such ERISA Partner or the General Partner shall obtain and
deliver to the other an opinion of counsel (which opinion and counsel shall be
reasonably acceptable to both such ERISA Partner and the General Partner) to the
effect that (a) such ERISA Limited Partner (or any employee benefit plan or plan
any assets of which are held by such ERISA Limited Partner) may be in violation
of ERISA, the Code or rules or regulations promulgated thereunder by reason of
such ERISA Limited Partner's continuing as a Limited Partner, or (b) the
fiduciaries of such ERISA Limited Partner (or fiduciaries of an employee benefit
plan or plan the assets of which are held by such ERISA Limited Partner, as
applicable), would have liability for the acts or omissions of the General
Partner, notwithstanding the provisions of section 405(d) of ERISA, or (c) the
Partnership or the General Partner may or would be in violation of ERISA or the
Code by continuing to have such ERISA Limited Partner as a member. In the event
of the issuance and delivery of such opinion of counsel, the General Partner
shall promptly provide to each Partner a copy thereof, together with a copy of
the written notice of the election of such ERISA Partner to withdraw or the
written demand of the General Partner for withdrawal, as the case may be.

         SECTION 16.03. Cure Period; Time of Withdrawal. The General Partner
shall have, in its sole discretion, a period of 90 days following receipt of
such counsel's opinion to attempt to eliminate the necessity for such withdrawal
to the reasonable satisfaction of such ERISA Partner and the General Partner,
whether by correction of the condition giving rise to the necessity of such
ERISA Partner's withdrawal, by amendment of this Agreement, by effectuation of a
transfer



                                     - 41 -


<PAGE>



of such ERISA Partner's interest in the Partnership to a substituted Limited
Partner at a fair and reasonable price (provided such ERISA Partner consents to
such transfer) or otherwise. If such cause for withdrawal is not cured within
such 90-day period, then such ERISA Partner shall withdraw from the Partnership
as of the date following the expiration of such 90-day period (or, if the
General Partner elects in writing not to attempt so to cure, as of the date
following such election) which is the earlier of (a) the last day of the fiscal
year of the Partnership during which such 90-day period expires or during which
the General Partner so elects not to attempt a cure, as the case may be, and (b)
the last day of the fiscal quarter of the Partnership during which such 90-day
period expires or during which the General Partner so elects not to attempt a
cure, as the case may be, provided that the last day of such fiscal quarter is
recommended for withdrawal by counsel in such opinion (the earlier of (a) and
(b) being herein referred to as the "ERISA WITHDRAWAL DATE"). The reasonable
costs of obtaining or seeking an opinion of counsel for purposes of this Section
16.03, whether or not such opinion is to the effect specified above or results
in the withdrawal of the ERISA Partner, shall be borne by the ERISA Partner.

         SECTION 16.04. Effects of ERISA Partner Withdrawal. Effective upon the
ERISA Withdrawal Date, such ERISA Partner shall cease to be a Partner of the
Partnership for all purposes and, except for its right to receive payment for
its Partnership interest as hereinafter provided, shall no longer be entitled to
the rights of a Partner under this Agreement, including without limitation the
right to receive allocations pursuant to Article X hereof, the right to receive
distributions during the term of the Partnership pursuant to Article XI and upon
liquidation of the Partnership pursuant to Article XIV and the right to vote on
Partnership matters as provided in this Agreement. As promptly as practicable
following the ERISA Withdrawal Date, the General Partner shall, where necessary,
file and record any required amendment to the Certificate reflecting such
withdrawal.

         SECTION 16.05. Distribution to ERISA Partner. As promptly as
practicable following the ERISA Withdrawal Date, there shall be distributed to
such ERISA Partner, in full payment and satisfaction of its interest in the
Partnership, an amount equal to the amount which such ERISA Partner would have
been entitled to receive pursuant to Article XIV if the Partnership had been
liquidated on and as of the ERISA Withdrawal Date and all of the Partnership's
assets had been sold on such date for their fair market value. No approval of
the Partners shall be required prior to the making of such distribution. For
purposes of determining the amount of the distribution to be made to such ERISA
Partner, and the value of each of the Partnership's assets, the Partnership's
annual or quarterly financial statements, as the case may be, prepared in
accordance with Article XIX hereof for the period ending on the ERISA Withdrawal
Date shall be deemed to be conclusive. Such distribution to the withdrawing
ERISA Partner shall be payable in cash, cash equivalents and/or securities of
Portfolio Companies, with each separate group of cash, cash equivalents,
securities of Portfolio Companies and/or other assets (determined in a manner
consistent with the last sentence of Section 11.04(d)) being distributed to the
withdrawing ERISA Partner in proportion to such ERISA Partner's interest in the
Partnership to the extent practicable, unless otherwise required by law or
contract.

<PAGE>




         SECTION 16.06. Conforming Amendment. Upon the withdrawal of any ERISA
Partner from the Partnership pursuant to this Article XVI, the Partners
(including the withdrawing ERISA Partner) shall enter into an amendment to this
Agreement reflecting such withdrawal and amending such provisions of this
Agreement, including without limitation the provisions regarding allocations and
distributions during the term of the Partnership and upon its liquidation, as
may be appropriate, so that the intent, spirit, operation and effect of such
allocation, distribution and other provisions shall, to the maximum extent
possible, be preserved after taking into account the withdrawal of such ERISA
Partner.

         SECTION 16.07. PERISA Partner Withdrawal. For purposes of Sections
16.02, 16.03, 16.04, 16.05 and 16.06, (a) each Limited Partner that is an
employee benefit plan subject to regulation under applicable state laws that are
similar in purpose and intent to ERISA (a "PUBLIC EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT SECURITY
ACT PARTNER" or "PERISA PARTNER") shall be treated as an ERISA Partner, and (b)
all references in such provisions to ERISA shall be deemed to refer to such
applicable state laws and regulations.



                                  ARTICLE XVII

            LIMITATION ON TRANSFER OF INTEREST OF THE GENERAL PARTNER

         SECTION 17.01. Limitation on Transfer of Interest of the General
Partner. The General Partner shall not assign, pledge, mortgage, hypothecate,
sell or otherwise dispose of or encumber all or any part of its general
partnership interest. Any attempted transfer of the General Partner's interest

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

         SECTION 18.01. General Provisions. The General Partner, its partners,
officers, directors, members, managers, employees, consultants and agents
(including the officers, directors, employees, members, managers, consultants
and agents of each partner of the General Partner), each director, officer,
employee, consultant and agent of the Management Company and each member of the
Advisory Committee (herein referred to as an "INDEMNITEE") shall be indemnified
by the Partnership (only out of Partnership assets, including the proceeds of
liability insurance) against any claim, demand, controversy, dispute, cost,
loss, damage, expense (including attorneys' fees), judgment and/or liability
incurred by or imposed upon the Indemnitee in connection with any action, suit
or proceeding (including any proceeding before any administrative or legislative
body or agency) to which the Indemnitee may be a party or



                                     - 43 -

otherwise involved, or with which the Indemnitee may be threatened, by reason of
the Indemnitee's (or the Indemnitee's employee) being at the time the cause of
action arose or thereafter, the General Partner (including the General Partner
acting as Tax Matters Partner), a partner thereof (including the officers,
directors, employees, members, managers, consultants and agents of each partner
of the General Partner), an officer, director, employee, member, manager,
consultant or other agent of the General Partner, or of the Management Company
or a member of the Advisory Committee, or a director, officer, partner,
employee, member, manager, consultant or other agent of any other organization
in which the Partnership owns an interest or of which the Partnership is a
creditor, which other organization the Indemnitee (or its employee) serves or
has served as a director, officer, partner, employee, member, manager,
consultant or other agent at the request of the Partnership (whether or not the
Indemnitee or its employee continues to serve in such capacity at the time such
action, suit or proceeding is brought or threatened), except with respect to
matters as to which the Indemnitee (or its employee) shall have been finally
adjudicated in any such action, suit or proceeding (i) not to have acted in good
faith and in the belief that the Indemnitee's (or employee's) action was in
accordance with such Person's obligations to the Partnership, (ii) to have acted
with gross negligence or a willful disregard of his duties or (iii) with respect
to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had cause to believe beyond any
reasonable doubt the Indemnitee's (or employee's) conduct was criminal. In the
event of settlement of any action, suit or proceeding brought or threatened,
such indemnification shall apply to all matters covered by the settlement. The
foregoing right of indemnification shall be in addition to any rights to which
any Indemnitee may otherwise be entitled and shall inure to the benefit of the
executors, administrators, personal representatives, successors or assigns of
each such Indemnitee.

         SECTION 18.02. Advance Payment of Expenses. The Partnership shall pay
the expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in defending a civil or criminal action,
suit or proceeding, or in opposing any claim arising in connection with any
potential or threatened civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding, in advance
of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding, upon receipt of an
undertaking by such Indemnitee to repay such payment if he shall be determined
to be not entitled to indemnification therefor as provided herein; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that in such instance the Indemnitee is not commencing an action, suit,
or proceeding against the Partnership, or defending an action, suit or
proceeding commenced against him by the Partnership or opposing a claim by the
Partnership arising in connection with any such potential or threatened action,
suit or proceeding.

         SECTION 18.03. Insurance. The General Partner, on behalf of the
Partnership, may cause the Partnership to purchase and maintain insurance with
such limits or coverages as the General Partner reasonably deems appropriate, at
the expense of the Partnership and to the extent available, for the protection
of any Indemnitee against any liability incurred by such Indemnitee in any such
capacity or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Partnership
has the power to indemnify such Indemnitee against such liability. The General
Partner may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of the Partnership for the
protection of any officer, director,



                                     - 44 -


<PAGE>



employee, consultant or other agent of any other organization in which the
Partnership owns an interest or of which the Partnership is a creditor against
similar liabilities, whether or not the Partnership has the power to indemnify
him or it against such liabilities.

         SECTION 18.04. Sharing of Indemnification Expenses with Related Funds.
It is understood and agreed that, with regard to any claim for indemnification
pursuant to this Article XVIII which relates to a common activity of the
Partnership and the Offshore Partnership or any Successor Entity, the
Partnership shall be obligated to provide indemnity hereunder up to, but only to
the extent of, its pro rata share of the total of any such amounts so paid by
any or all of the Partnership, the Offshore Partnership, or any Successor Entity
(i) if such claim arises from a Portfolio Company investment, in proportion to
the respective amounts invested by the Partnership and such other funds in such
Portfolio Company, and (ii) otherwise in proportion to the respective amounts of
capital contributed (in cash and commitments) to the respective partnerships or
related funds.

         SECTION 18.05. Limitation by Law. If the General Partner or the
Partnership is subject to any federal or state law, rule or regulation which
restricts the extent to which any person may be exonerated or indemnified by the
Partnership in any particular instance, then the indemnification provisions set
forth in this Article XVIII and the exoneration provisions set forth in Sections
3.10 and 14.05 shall be deemed to be amended, automatically and without further
action by the General Partner or the Limited Partners, to conform to such
restrictions on exoneration or indemnification as set forth in such applicable
federal or state law, rule or regulation. If any such law, statute, rule or
regulation of any jurisdiction by which the Partnership may be governed, is
thereafter amended to enlarge the scope of indemnification or eliminate or
reduce the liability of any Indemnitee, then this Agreement shall be deemed to
be amended, automatically and without any further action by the General Partner
or the Limited Partners to broaden correspondingly the exoneration or
indemnification provided hereunder; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the scope of the
exoneration or indemnification provided hereunder shall not be enlarged beyond
that which is set forth in this Article XVIII as of the date hereof. The rights
to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred in this Article XVIII
shall not be exclusive of any other right which any Indemnitee may have or
hereafter acquire under any law, statute, rule, regulation, charter document,
by-law, contract or agreement.

continues and until its complete liquidation, each Partner (or the designee
thereof) during normal business hours may fully examine and audit the
Partnership's books, records, accounts and assets, including bank balances, and
may make, or cause to be made, any examination or audit at such Partner's
expense. Each Limited Partner (or the designee thereof) during normal business
hours may examine, or request that the General Partner furnish, such additional
information as is reasonably necessary to enable the requesting Partner (or the
designee thereof) to review the state of the investment activities of the
Partnership. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) any such examination or audit
shall be made (A) only upon reasonable notice to the General Partner, (B) during
normal business hours and (C) without undue disruption; and (2) the management
of the affairs of the Partnership shall be in complete control of the General
Partner.

         SECTION 19.04. Annual Financial Statements. The General Partner shall

close of each fiscal year, a report indicating such Partner's share of all items
of income or gain, expense, loss or other deduction and tax credit of the
Partnership for such year, as well as the status of its Capital Account as of
the end of such year, and such additional information as it reasonably may
request to enable it to complete its tax returns or to fulfill any other
reporting requirements. For information purposes, the General Partner shall also
furnish to each Partner, as promptly as practicable after the close of each
fiscal year, a list of the Partnership's investments, valued at fair market
value as determined in accordance with Article XII as of the end of such fiscal
year, with a brief narrative report as to the status and operations of each such
investment.

year of the Partnership, unaudited financial statements of the Partnership for
the quarter then ended prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles consistently applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement

required footnotes), which statements shall contain data sufficient to inform
each Partner as to the current financial status of the Partnership and its
investments, with a brief narrative report as to the status and operations of
each such investment.

         SECTION 19.06. Annual Meetings. The Partnership may hold annual
meetings offering Limited Partners the opportunity to review and discuss the
Partnership's investment activity and portfolio. If the General Partner
determines that the Partnership shall hold an annual meeting, the General
Partner shall notify each Limited Partner at least 45 days in advance of the
time and place of the year's annual meeting, and request each Limited Partner
that wishes to send one or more representatives to that meeting so to notify the
General Partner. Any Limited Partner which does not notify the General Partner,
within 30 days after the General Partner's delivery of notice to such Partner
regarding an annual meeting for any year, of such Limited Partner's intention to
send a representative to that meeting shall be deemed to have consented to a
waiver of such Partner's right to attend that meeting. At the General Partner's
discretion, the annual meeting for a particular year may be held in several
locations at different times to make attendance more convenient for Limited
Partners from different geographic locations. At the General Partner's
discretion, individual meetings with interested Limited Partners may be held in
lieu of, or in addition to, an annual meeting.

         SECTION 19.07.  Accounting Method. The Partnership shall use the
accrual method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes.

         SECTION 20.01.  Waiver and Amendment.

         (a)  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the terms and
provisions of this Agreement may be waived, modified, terminated or amended with
the written consent of the General Partner and of Limited Partners constituting
in the aggregate at least a majority in interest of the Limited Partners. No
such amendment shall, however, (1) dilute the relative interest of any Partner
in the profits or capital of the Partnership or in allocations or distributions
attributable to the ownership of such interest without the written consent of
such Partner (except such dilution as may result from additional Subscriptions
from the Limited Partners or the admission of additional Limited Partners); or
(2) increase the Subscriptions of any Partner without the written consent of
such Partner; or (3) alter or waive the terms of: (A) Section 2.03 without the
written consent of each Limited Partner; and (B) Sections 3.11(c), 3.12, 3.13,
and 4.02 or Articles XVI and XX without the written consent of any Partner which
would be adversely affected thereby. The General Partner shall promptly furnish
copies of any amendments to this Agreement to all Partners. The admission or
substitution of Partners and increases in Subscriptions shall not require the
consent of, or notice to, any Limited Partner.

         (b)  In addition to any amendments otherwise authorized hereby, this
Agreement may be amended from time to time by the General Partner without the
consent of the Limited Partners to cure any ambiguity or correct or supplement
any provisions hereof which may be inconsistent with any other provision hereof,
or correct any printing, stenographic or clerical errors or omissions.

         (c) Except as otherwise specifically set forth in this Agreement, any
amendment, consent, waiver, modification or termination of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement which results in the same economic and legal
consequences to the Partners and the limited partner of the Offshore Partnership
shall require the written consent of the General Partner and the general
partners of the Offshore Partnership, and the written consent of Limited
Partners and the limited partner of the Offshore Partnership constituting, in
the aggregate, a majority in interest of all such Limited Partners and the
limited partner of the Offshore Partnership, voting together as a single class.

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS



                                     - 48 -


<PAGE>



         SECTION 21.01. Notices. Except where otherwise specifically provided in
this Agreement, all notices, requests, consents, approvals and statements shall
be in writing and shall be deemed to have been properly given by personal
delivery or if mailed from within the country of the sender by air mail or first
class mail, postage prepaid, or if sent by prepaid telegram, electronic
facsimile transmission or telex, or if sent by courier service, addressed in
each case, at its address set forth in SCHEDULE A, or, in each case, to such
other address or addresses as the addressee may have specified by written notice
as aforesaid to the other parties. Notices delivered by air mail shall be deemed
to be received five days after the date of the mailing.

         SECTION 21.02.  Power of Attorney.

         (a)  Each of the undersigned by execution of this Agreement constitutes
and appoints the General Partner as its true and lawful representative and
attorney-in-fact, in its name, place and stead, to make, execute, sign,
acknowledge and deliver or file (1) all instruments, documents and certificates
which may from time to time be required by any law to effectuate, implement and
continue the valid and subsisting existence of the Partnership, (2) all
instruments, documents and certificates that may be required to effectuate the
dissolution and termination of the Partnership in accordance with the provisions
hereof and Delaware law, (3) all other amendments of this Agreement or the
Certificate contemplated by this Agreement including, without limitation,
amendments reflecting the return, in whole or in part, of the contribution of
any Partner, or the addition, substitution or increased contribution of any
Partner, or any action of the Partners duly taken pursuant to this Agreement
whether or not such Partner voted in favor of or otherwise approved such action,
and (4) any other instrument, certificate or document required from time to time
to admit a Partner, to effect its substitution as a Partner, to effect the
substitution of the Partner's assignee as a Partner, or to reflect any action of
the Partners provided for in this Agreement.

         (b)  Each of the Partners is aware that the terms of this Agreement
permit certain amendments to this Agreement and the Certificate to be effected
and certain other actions to be taken by or with respect to the Partnership, in
each case with the approval or by the vote of less than all the Partners. If, as
and when (1) an amendment of this Agreement and the Certificate is proposed or
an action is proposed to be taken by or with respect to the Partnership which
does not require, under the terms of this Agreement, the approval of all of the
Partners, (2) Partners holding the interest in the Partnership specified in this
Agreement as being required for such amendment or action have approved such
amendment or action in the manner contemplated by this Agreement (disregarding
the consent of any Partner whose approval has been granted by the General
Partner's use of such Partner's power of attorney), and (3) a Partner has failed
or refused to approve such amendment or action (hereinafter referred to as a
non-consenting Partner), each non-consenting Partner agrees that the special
attorney specified above, with full power of substitution, is hereby authorized
and empowered to execute, acknowledge, make, swear to, verify, deliver, record,
file and/or publish, for and on behalf of such non-consenting Partner, and in
its name, place and stead, any and all instruments and documents which may be
necessary or



                                     - 49 -


<PAGE>



appropriate to permit such amendment to be lawfully made or action lawfully
taken. Each Partner is fully aware that it and each other Partner has executed
this special power of attorney, and that each Partner will rely on the
effectiveness of such powers with a view to the orderly administration of the
Partnership's affairs.

         (c)  The powers of attorney granted herein (1) shall be deemed to be
coupled with an interest, shall be irrevocable and shall survive the death,
insanity, incompetency or incapacity (or, in the case of a Partner that is a
corporation, association, limited liability company, partnership or trust, shall
survive the merger, dissolution or other termination of existence) of the
Partner and (2) shall survive the assignment by the Partner of the whole or any
portion of his interest, except that where the assignee of the whole or any
portion thereof has furnished a power of attorney, this power of attorney shall
survive such assignment for the sole purpose of enabling the General Partner to
execute, acknowledge and file any instrument necessary to effect any permitted
substitution of the assignee for the assignor as a Partner and shall thereafter
terminate. In the event that the appointment conferred in this Section 21.02
would not constitute a legal and valid appointment by any Partner under the laws
of the jurisdiction in which such Partner is incorporated, established or
resident, upon the request of the General Partner, such Partner shall deliver to
the General Partner a properly authenticated and duly executed document
constituting a legal and valid power of attorney under the laws of the
appropriate jurisdiction covering the matters set forth in this Section 21.02.

         (d)  The General Partner shall require a power of attorney to be
executed by a transferee of a Partner as a condition of its admission as a
substitute Partner.

         SECTION 21.03.  Waiver of Partition.  Each Partner hereby irrevocably
waives any and all rights that it may have to maintain an action for partition
of any of the Partnership's property.

         SECTION 21.04. Additional Documents. Each Partner hereby agrees to
execute all certificates, counterparts, amendments, instruments or documents
that may be required by the laws of the various jurisdictions in which the
Partnership conducts its activities, to conform with the laws of such
jurisdictions governing limited partnerships.

         SECTION 21.05. Binding on Successors. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and it shall inure to the benefit of the respective heirs, successors,
assigns and legal representatives of the parties hereto.

         SECTION 21.06. Counterparts. This Agreement or any amendment hereto may
be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but
all of which taken together shall constitute one agreement (or amendment, as the
case may be).

<PAGE>



         SECTION 21.07. Action by Limited Partners. Whenever action is required
by this Agreement to be taken by a specified percentage in interest of the
Limited Partners, such action shall be deemed to be valid if taken upon written
vote or written consent by those Limited Partners whose Contributions Account
balances represent the specified percentage of the aggregate Contributions
Account balances of all Limited Partners at the time.

         SECTION 21.08. Voting. Any vote or other action required or permitted
to be taken by this Agreement may be taken by written consent signed by not less
than the requisite percentage in interest of parties required or permitted to
take such vote or other action.

         SECTION 21.09. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that the nature and extent of the obligation of any member of the
Advisory Committee to Persons other than the Partnership and any one or more
Partners in their capacities as such shall be determined under the laws of the
jurisdiction or jurisdictions imposing such obligations.

         SECTION 21.10. Securities Act Matters. Each Partner understands that in
addition to the restrictions on transfer contained in this Agreement, it must
bear the economic risks of its investment for an indefinite period because the
Partnership interests have not been registered under the Securities Act and,
therefore, may not be sold or otherwise transferred unless they are registered
under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available.
Each Partner agrees with all other Partners that it will not sell or otherwise
transfer its interest in the Partnership unless such interest has been so
registered or in the opinion of counsel for the Partnership, or of other counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Partnership, such an exemption is available.

         SECTION 21.11. Right to Rely on Authority of General Partner. No Person
that is not a Partner, in dealing with the General Partner, shall be required to
determine such General Partner's authority to make any commitment or engage in
any undertaking on behalf of the Partnership, or to determine any fact or
circumstance bearing upon the existence of the authority of the General Partner.

         SECTION 21.12. Tax Matters Partner. The "TAX MATTERS PARTNER", as
defined in Section 6231 of the Code, of the Partnership shall be the General
Partner (the "TAX MATTERS PARTNER"). The Tax Matters Partner shall not resign as
tax matters partner of the Partnership unless, on the effective date of such
resignation, the Partnership has designated another general partner as Tax
Matters Partner and that general partner has given its consent in writing to its
appointment as Tax Matters Partner. The Tax Matters Partner shall receive no
additional compensation from the Partnership for its services in that capacity,
but all expenses incurred by the Tax Matters Partner shall be borne by the
Partnership. The Tax Matters Partner is authorized to employ such accountants,
attorneys and agents as it, in its sole discretion, determines are necessary to
or useful in the performance of its duties. Any Person who serves as Tax Matters



                                     - 51 -


<PAGE>



Partner shall not be liable to the Partnership or to any Partner for any action
it takes or fails to take as Tax Matters Partner with respect to any
administrative or judicial proceeding involving "PARTNERSHIP ITEMS" (as defined
in Section 6231 of the Code) of the Partnership, unless such action or failure
to act constitutes a violation of the General Partner's duty of care set forth
in Section 3.10.

         SECTION 21.13. Contract Construction. Whenever the content of this
Agreement permits, the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter
genders, and reference to singular or plural shall be interchangeable with the
other. The invalidity or unenforceability of any one or more provisions of this
Agreement shall not affect the other provisions, and this Agreement shall be
construed in all respects as if any such invalid or unenforceable provision(s)
were omitted. References in this Agreement to particular sections of the Code or
to provisions of Delaware law shall be deemed to refer to such sections or
provisions as they may be amended after the date of this Agreement.

         SECTION 21.14. Section Headings. Captions in this Agreement are for
convenience only and do not define or limit any term of this Agreement.
