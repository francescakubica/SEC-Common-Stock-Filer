                             (Page 7 of 22 Pages)

    Certain information with respect to the directors and executive officers 
of R-H Inc. and Travelers is set forth on Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto, 
including each director's and executive officer's business address, present 
principal occupation or employment, citizenship and other information, which 
information is incorporated herein by reference.

    (d) and (e)  On May 20, 1992, Salomon Brothers Inc ("SBI") and SSB
Holdings, (together with SBI, "Salomon") consented, without admitting or denying
any of the allegations of the concurrently filed complaint, to the entry of a
Final Judgment of Permanent Injunction and Other Relief (the "Final Judgment")
in settlement of an action arising out of alleged misconduct in auctions of U.S.
Treasury securities and government securities trading, brought by the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York, entitled SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION V.
SALOMON INC. AND SALOMON BROTHERS INC (92 Civ. 3691 and Securities and Exchange
Act Release No. 30721 (May 20, 1992)) (the "Treasury Matter").  Among other
things, the Final Judgment enjoins Salomon from violations of Section 17(a) of
the Securities Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act"), Sections 10(b), 15(c)(1) and 17(a)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "1934 Act"), and rules 10b-5,
15c1-2, 17a-3 and 17a-4 promulgated thereunder.  Pursuant to the settlement,
Salomon was required to pay a total amount of $290,000,000, with $100,000,000
going to a fund for the payment of private claims for compensatory damages
arising out of the U.S. Treasury auction and related matters and $190,000,000 to
the United States in payment of civil penalties under the Securities Enforcement
Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990 and a forfeiture of assets to and
settlement of claims with the Department of Justice against SBI.  On the same
day, in other related actions solely involving SBI, the SEC instituted and
settled an administrative proceeding relating to a failure to supervise the
persons responsible for the alleged misconduct, the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York announced the continuation of SBI's primary dealer designation but a
cessation of its trading activity until August 3, 1992, and the Department of
Treasury announced that SBI would be permitted to resume bidding for customers
on August 3, 1992, having restricted SBI to purchasing securities for its own
account in U.S. Treasury auctions since August 18, 1991.

    In January and February 1993, SBI, without admitting or denying any
allegations, entered into consent agreements and, in some states, consent orders
with 41 state securities regulators in settlement of certain claims in respect
of SBI's state broker-dealer registrations arising out of SBI's activities
described in the Treasury Matter.  Pursuant to the settlement with the states,
SBI agreed, among other things, to (i) comply with those provisions of the order
issued by the SEC in the Treasury Matter that imposed remedial sanctions with
respect to alleged violations of securities laws by former personnel of SBI in
auctions for United States Treasury Securities during 1990 and 1991; (ii) pay
$50,000 to each state participant in the settlement as reimbursement for costs
of investigation related to the Treasury Matter; and (iii) 


                                 (Page 8 of 22 Pages)
<PAGE>

with respect to some states, contribute $2,000,000 to a multi-state investor
protection trust fund to be created for the purpose of providing funds for
projects promoting the cause of investor protection.

    On July 17, 1996, the Department of Justice filed a civil complaint in the
Southern District of New York alleging that SBI, Smith Barney Inc. and 22 other
broker/dealers, as well as unnamed co-conspirators, violated section 1 of the
Sherman Act in conjunction with the trading of Nasdaq securities.  A proposed
settlement with all 24 defendants was filed concurrently.  The proposed
settlement did not contain any admission of liability; it also did not include
any fine, penalty or injunction.  Under the proposed settlement, the defendants
agreed, among other things, to institute specified antitrust compliance
procedures on their over-the-counter desks, with the court retaining
jurisdiction for enforcement of the settlement agreement, including punishment
by contempt.  In April 1997, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District
of New York approved the settlement.  In May 1997, the plaintiffs in a related
civil class action challenged certain provisions of the settlement.

    On August 26, 1996, the SEC simultaneously instituted a cease-and-desist
proceeding pursuant to Section 21C of the 1934 Act against SSB Holdings and
accepted SSB Holdings's Offer of Settlement.  SSB Holdings, by its Offer of
Settlement, consented to the imposition of a cease-and-desist order and the
entry of the findings therein without admitting or denying such findings.  The
SEC found that SSB Holdings had violated Section 13(b)(2) of the 1934 Act. 
Specifically, the SEC determined that SSB Holdings had failed to perform
thorough and timely reconciliations of its balance sheet accounts to supporting
documentation, and thus failed to identify on a timely basis erroneous entries
made by its staff.  Moreover, SSB Holdings had failed to ensure that correction
procedures were properly implemented in London, in part by failing to train
adequately its staff to use a new automated system.  These failures resulted in
the overstatement of assets and income on the books, records, and accounts of
SSB Holdings and its subsidiaries.  In determining to accept SSB Holdings's
Offer of Settlement, the SEC considered remedial acts promptly undertaken by SSB
Holdings and cooperation afforded the SEC staff.

    Except as set forth or incorporated by reference herein, during the last
five years, none of Travelers, SSB Holdings, R-H Inc., R-H/Travelers, R-H
Partners or, to the best knowledge of Travelers, any of the persons listed in
Exhibit 99.1 hereto, has been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding
traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or has been a party to a civil
proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as
a result of such proceeding was or is subject to any material judgment, decree
or final order 


                                 (Page 9 of 22 Pages)

enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject
to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to
such laws.


ITEM 3.  SOURCE AND AMOUNT OF FUNDS OR OTHER CONSIDERATION

    R-H Partners purchased an aggregate of $2,750,000 principal amount of the
10.0% senior subordinated notes due October 16, 2000 of Dealers Alliance Credit
Corp. (the "Notes") and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 12,369 shares of
common stock of Dealers Alliance Credit Corp. (the "Warrants") on October 16,
1995 and December 21, 1995, for aggregate consideration of $2,750,000.  On
August 2, 1996, Dealers Alliance Credit Corp. entered into an Asset Acquisition
Agreement (the "Asset Acquisition Agreement") with the Issuer and Search Funding
IV, Inc. pursuant to which Dealers Alliance Credit Corp. sold substantially all
of its assets to Search Funding IV, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Issuer.  In connection with the Asset Acquisition Agreement, R-H Partners
entered into a Sub-Debt Acquisition Agreement, dated August 2, 1996, by and
among the Issuer, R-H Partners, Kellett Investment Corporation and Search
Funding IV, Inc. pursuant to which Search Funding IV, Inc. purchased the Notes
and Warrants from R-H Partners.  The aggregate purchase price paid to R-H
Partners for the Notes and the Warrants was 1,229,141 shares of series B 9%/7%
convertible preferred stock, of the issuer.  Effective November 25, 1996, all
outstanding shares of such B Series 9%/7% convertible preferred stock were
converted into shares of Preferred Stock on a one-for-on basis.  On November 21,
1996, the Issuer effected a one-for-eight reverse stock split of the Preferred
Stock which had the effect of decreasing the number of shares owned by R-H
Partners to 153,642 shares.


ITEM 4.  PURPOSE OF TRANSACTION

    The acquisition of the shares of Preferred Stock by R-H Capital occurred in
connection with the sale of the assets of Dealers Alliance Credit Corp.

    Each of the Reporting Persons reviews its holdings with respect to the 
Issuer on a continuing basis.  Depending on such evaluations of the Issuer's 
business and prospects, and upon future developments (including, but not 
limited to, market prices of the Preferred Stock and availability and 
alternative uses of funds, as well as conditions in the securities markets 
and general economic and industry conditions), each such Reporting Person 
may acquire other securities of the Issuer or sell all or a portion of its 
Preferred Stock or other securities of the issuer, now owned or hereafter 
acquired.  Except as otherwise described herein, none of the Reporting 
Persons has any plans or proposals relating to or which would result in any 
of the transactions described in Items 4 (a)-(j) of Schedule 13D.
