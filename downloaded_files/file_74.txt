         executive officer of KCMC.  Mr. Kingdon has not, during
         the last five years, been convicted in a criminal

         misdemeanors).  Mr. Kingdon has not, during the last
         five years, been a party to a civil proceeding of a
         judicial or administrative body of competent
         jurisdiction which resulted in a judgment, decree or
         final order enjoining future violations of, or
         prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal
         or state securities laws or finding any violations with
         respect to such laws.

         Mr. Kingdon is a citizen of the United States of
         America.

Item 3.  Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.

         As of the date hereof, KCMC is deemed to beneficially
         own 700,000 shares of Common Stock.  All 700,000 shares
         of Common Stock are held by entities and managed
         accounts over which KCMC has investment discretion.  The
         700,000 shares of the Common Stock were purchased in
         open market transactions at an aggregate cost of
         $5,317,317.03.  The funds for the purchase of the Common
         Stock held in the entities and managed accounts over
         which KCMC has investment discretion have come from each

         entity's or account's own funds.  No leverage was used
         to purchase any shares.

Item 4.  Purpose of Transactions.

         The shares of Common Stock deemed to be beneficially
         owned by KCMC were acquired for, and are being held for,
         investment purposes.

         KCMC has no plan or proposal which relates to, or would
         result in, any of the actions enumerated in Item 4 of
         the instructions to Schedule 13D.

Item 5.  Interest in Securities of Issuer.

         As of the date hereof, KCMC is deemed to be the
         beneficial owner of 700,000 shares of Common Stock.

         as of August 31, 1997 there were 10,473,137 shares of
         Common Stock outstanding.  Therefore, KCMC is deemed to
         beneficially own 6.68% of the outstanding shares of
         Common Stock.  KCMC has the sole power to vote, direct
         the vote, dispose of or direct the disposition of all
         the shares of Common Stock that it is currently deemed
         to beneficially own.  The purpose of this filing is to
         show that KCMC has become the beneficial owner of more
         than 5% of MGXI's common shares outstanding.

Item 6.  Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or
         Relationships with Respect to Securities of the Issuer.

         KCMC has no contract, arrangement, understanding or
         relationship with any person with respect to the Common
         Stock.

Item 7.  Material to be Filed as Exhibits.

         Attached hereto as Exhibit A is a description of the
