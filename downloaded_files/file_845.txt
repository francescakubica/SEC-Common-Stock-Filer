/*/ For purposes of this Statement on Schedule 13D the Reporting Persons have

          Each of Raptor Ltd., Raptor L.P., TAP and Tudor BVI is an investment
  fund which principally invests in debt, equity, derivative securities and
  other financial instruments for the benefit of the holders of its partnership,
  stock and other capital securities.

          The name, residence or business address, present principal occupation
  or employment, the name, principal business and address of any corporation or
  other organization in which such employment is conducted and the citizenship
  of each natural person that is a director or executive officer of TIC, Raptor
  Ltd. or Tudor BVI is set forth on Schedule I hereto and is incorporated by
  reference herein.  TIC is the sole general partner of Raptor L.P.

          Effective as of July 31, 1995, TIC ceased to provide investment
  advisory services to Danforth.  Accordingly, Danforth is no longer included as
  a reporting person.

          During the last five years, none of the Reporting Persons, or to the
  best knowledge and belief of the Reporting Persons, any of the individuals
  listed on Schedule I hereto, has been convicted in a criminal proceeding
  (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or has been a party to
  a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent
  jurisdiction as a result of which any Reporting Person or any person listed on
  Schedule I was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining
  future violations of, or prohibiting activities subject to, federal or state
  securities laws or finding any violation of such law.

  Item 3.  Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.
           ------------------------------------------------- 

          The shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by each of Raptor Ltd.,
  Raptor L.P., TAP and Tudor BVI were acquired in open market purchases for
  cash.  The sources of the funds used to purchase the shares of Common Stock by
  each of the Reporting Persons were (i) capital contributions to such Reporting
  Person, (ii) the proceeds of transactions with respect to prior investments
  held by such Reporting Persons, and (iii) cash borrowed pursuant to margin
  loans with Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, which are secured by all of the
  shares of Common Stock held by each such Reporting Person.

                                     Page 9
<PAGE>
 
  Item 4.  Purpose of Transaction.
           ---------------------- 

          Each of Raptor Ltd., Raptor L.P., TAP and Tudor BVI initially acquired
  the Common Stock beneficially owned by such Reporting Person for investment
  purposes.  Each of such Reporting Persons intends to continue to evaluate
  their respective investments in Common Stock based on the Company's financial
  condition, results of operations and prospects as well as other then existing
  or anticipated facts and circumstances including general economic, market and
  other financial conditions.  Accordingly, each of the Reporting Persons
  reserves the right to change its plans and intentions with respect to its
  investment in securities of the Company at any time, as it deems appropriate.
  In particular, each of the Reporting Persons may at any time and from time to
  time (i) acquire additional shares of Common Stock, (ii) dispose of Common
  Stock, or (iii) enter into privately negotiated derivative transactions with
  institutional counterparties to hedge the market risk of some or all of its
  positions in the Common Stock.  There can be no assurance that any Reporting
  Person will increase or decrease his investment in the Company or as to the
  number of shares of Common Stock or derivative securities that may be bought
  or sold in any such transactions.

          Except as set forth in this Schedule 13D, none of the Reporting
  Persons currently has any plans or proposals which relate to or would result
  in any of the transactions, actions or events enumerated in paragraphs (a)
  through (j) of the instructions to Item 4 of Schedule 13D.

  Item 5.  Interest in Securities of the Issuer.
           ------------------------------------ 

          There have been no transactions by the Reporting Persons since the
  transactions on June 21, 1995 which were previously reported in the Schedule
  13D.

          As of December 18, 1995, as a result of the conversion of shares of
  preferred stock for Common Stock by certain of the Company's shareholders
  other than the Reporting Persons, none of the Reporting Persons remained the
  beneficial owner, pursuant to Rule 13(d)(1)(i), of more than 5% of the Common
  Stock of the Company.

          Because TIC is the sole general partner of Raptor L.P. and provides
  investment advisory services to Raptor Ltd., Raptor L.P. and Tudor BVI, TIC
  may be deemed to beneficially own the shares of Common Stock owned by each of
  such Reporting Persons.  In addition, because Mr. Jones owns a majority of the
  capital stock and voting securities of TIC and indirectly owns a majority of
  the equity interests in the general partner of TAP, Mr. Jones may be 

                                    Page 10
<PAGE>
 
  deemed to beneficially own the shares of Common Stock deemed beneficially
  owned by TIC and TAP.

          Based on the information provided by the Company that there are
  approximately 2,959,698 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding, each
  Reporting Person beneficially owns (or, with respect to TIC and Mr. Jones, may
  be deemed to beneficially own) the number and percentage of outstanding shares
  of Common Stock listed in the responses to Items 11 and 13, respectively, of
  the cover page filed herewith for such Reporting Person.  In addition, the
  number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned (or, with respect to TIC
  and Mr. Jones, which may be deemed beneficially owned) by each Reporting
  Person with respect to which such Reporting Person (i) has sole voting power,
  (ii) shares voting power, (iii) has sole dispositive power and (iv) shares
  dispositive power are listed in the responses to Items 7, 8, 9 and 10,
  respectively, of the cover page filed herewith for such Reporting Person.  The
  voting and dispositive power is reported as shared because each of the
  Reporting Persons (other than TIC and Mr. Jones) has the power to remove TIC
  as its investment advisor or general partner.  Each of the Reporting Persons
  (other than TIC and Mr. Jones) expressly disclaim beneficial ownership of the
  shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by any other Reporting Person and
  each of TIC and Mr. Jones disclaim beneficial ownership of the Common Stock
  beneficially owned by Raptor Ltd., Raptor L.P., TAP, Tudor BVI.

  Item 6.  Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings
           or Relationships with Respect to Securities
           of the Issuer
           -------------------------------------------

          Except as set forth in this Schedule 13D, none of the Reporting Person
  has any contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships with respect
  to securities of the Company.

  Item 7.  Material to Be Filed as Exhibits
           --------------------------------

          (1) Joint Filing Agreement (previously filed)
