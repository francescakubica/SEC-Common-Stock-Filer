The Performance Fee referred to in Clause 5(5) of the Agreement shall be
calculated and payable as follows:

1.   As further consideration for the performance of the Services, GIM shall be
     entitled to receive on 1st July in each year a Performance Fee which shall
     be calculated as the amount equivalent to a percentum of Funds (as
     calculated below) of the Company as at 31st March each year (an in respect
     of any period, to which this Agreement applies, of less or more than twelve
     months the Performance Fee shall be decreased or (as the case may be)
     increased in proportion to the amount by which the period in question is
     less than 365 days or exceeds 365 days, as the case may be).

2.   In the event of any change in the financial year end of the Company from
     31st January in any year, the period covered by this Schedule shall be
     altered so that any current period the subject of this Schedule shall
     expire on the date falling two calendar months after the date of the new
     financial year end of the Company and so that:

     (a) any such new period covered by this Schedule shall always commence on
         the date falling two calendar months and one day after the expiry of
         the financial period of the Company;

     (b) payment pursuant to paragraph 1 above shall be made on the date falling
         six calendar months and one day after the new financial year end date
         of the Company;

     (c) all references to 31st March in this Schedule shall then be deemed to
         apply to the date falling two months after the new financial year end
         of the Company; and

     (d) in the event of any further change in the financial year end of the
         Company the provisions of this sentence shall apply "mutatis mutandis".

3.   In addition, if the appointment of GIM under this Agreement terminates
     otherwise than on 31st March (or such date on which the relevant twelve
     month period ends) GIM shall be entitled to a proportionate part of the fee
     which would have been payable to it if the appointment had been effective
     during the whole of the twelve month period in question.

<PAGE>
4.   Such percentum will be calculated from the fraction arising in accordance
     with the following formula:

(A - 1) x 0.1
(B    )

Where

     Composite Index at                           US$ per(pound)1 at the
B -  the Relevant Year End                        Preceding Year Date
     ---------------------                        ----------------------

                                        x

     the Standard & Poors'                        rate of exchange of
     Composite Index at                           US$ per(pound)1 at the
     the Preceding Year Date                      Relevant Year Date

     Provided always that the percentum shall not be less than nil and not
     greater than 0.5 per cent.

5.   In the event of the issue of new shares, debentures or other loan capital
     by the Company for value or in the event of any shares, debentures or other
     loan capital of the Company being repaid during the relevant period, item A
     shall be adjusted as the Board of Directors may determine and the Company's
     auditors shall confirm as fair and reasonable.

6.   In the event of any dispute between GIM and the Board of Directors as to
     the value to be attributed to the Investments or any of them pursuant to
     these provisions the value shall be determined by the auditors of the
     Company acting as experts and not as arbitrators and their valuation shall
     be final and binding upon the parties and the provisions of paragraph 7
     below shall apply to the calculation of the Performance Fee.

         date of the last audited balance sheet to the date of the calculation;

     (b) the Board of Directors' valuation of all unquoted investments on such
         date of calculation in accordance with a statement of value prepared
         for and approved by the Board of Directors in accordance with
         procedures and on a basis reviewed by the Company's auditors;

     (c) the payment of any dividend or the making of any other distribution to
         shareholders of the Company.

8.   Subject to the provisions of this Schedule the Performance Fee shall be
     paid on 1st July in respect of the twelve month period commencing on 1st
     April in the preceding calendar year and ending on 31st March in the
     current calendar year.

     conduct of investment business by it, whose registered office is at 10 Park

                                                       (address)

NOW IT IS HEREBY AGREED as follows:

APPOINTMENT AND STATUS OF CLIENT

1.   The Client, a Private Customer as defined in the Rules of IMRO, hereby
     appoints JOHP to act as discretionary investment manager, subject to the
     terms and conditions hereof, in relation to the Client's investments and
     cash which are from time to time placed under the management of JOHP (the
     "Portfolio") and JOHP hereby agrees to manage and administer the Portfolio.
     The appointment will commence on the date on which this Agreement is
     delivered to JOHP by the Client having been signed first by the Client then
     by JOHP. The assets comprising the Portfolio and their opening value are
     set out in Schedule 1.

MANAGEMENT OF INVESTMENTS

2.   JOHP shall have complete discretion, power and authority to manage the
     Portfolio and to make investments and changes in investments on the
     Client's behalf and as the Client's agent within the investment policy
     agreed between JOHP and the Client and set out in Part I of Schedule II.
     Such policy shall be subject to the guidelines and restrictions set out in
     Part II of Schedule II and to any guidelines, restrictions and instructions
     specified in writing from time to time by the Client or by the Client's
     duly authorized agent (written notice of whose authority shall have been
     received by JOHP). The Client's attention is specifically drawn to the
     warnings set out in Part III of Schedule II.

<PAGE>

3.   JOHP shall not be obliged to undertake the management of investments the
     management of which would in its opinion be onerous to it.

DEALING TERMS

4.   Subject as set out in paragraph 9, in effecting transactions for the
     Portfolio JOHP shall seek best execution at all times and may (subject to
     the investment policy set out in Part I of Schedule II) deal on such
     markets or exchanges and with such counterparties as it thinks fit. The
     Client agrees that all such transactions will be effected in accordance
     with the rules and regulations of the relevant market or exchange and that
     JOHP may take all such steps as may be required or permitted by such rules
     and regulations and/or by good market practice.

5.   The Client's investments or documents of title or certificates evidencing
     title to investments or any other property belonging to the Client will not
     be lent by JOHP to a third party except as otherwise agreed between the
     Client and JOHP in writing.

6.   JOHP may supplement the funds in the Portfolio by borrowing on the Client's
     behalf but only for the purpose of funding short-term deficiencies arising
     in the normal course of JOHP's duties hereunder to an extent which is not
     material in the context of the Portfolio taken as a whole. JOHP will not
     borrow money on the Client's behalf against the security of any of the
     Client's investments, documents of title or property.

7.   JOHP may commit the Client to underwrite any issue or offer for sale of
     securities without the Client's prior written consent.

8.   JOHP may act as principal in any transaction for the Client provided that
     JOHP shall secure for the Client best execution of such transaction.

9.   Subject to the IMRO Rules, JOHP may, without prior reference to the Client,
     enter into a transaction on behalf of more than one client collectively.

10.  JOHP has the right under this Agreement to effect transactions on the
     Client's behalf in investments the price of which may be being stabilised.
     The attention of the Client is referred to the statement contained in
     Schedule II relating to stabilisation. Signature of this Agreement by or on
     behalf of the Client shall act as acknowledgment by the Client of receipt
     of such statement prior to entry into this Agreement.

<PAGE>
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

11.  Subject to paragraphs 12 and 13, JOHP shall not undertake any transactions
     on the Client's behalf in which JOHP has directly or indirectly a material
     interest or have any relationship with another party which may involve a
     conflict with JOHP's duty to the Client unless that interest or
     relationship is disclosed in writing to the Client.

12.  The Client's Portfolio may contain securities of which the issue or offer
     for sale is underwritten, managed or arranged by an Associate (as defined
     in the Rules of IMRO) of JOHP during the preceding twelve months.

13.  The Client understands that JOHP's directors or staff may from time to time
     hold shares or securities including holdings that may be in the Portfolio,
     and that JOHP's directors or staff may from time to time be directors of
     companies whose shares are held in the Portfolio.

14.  The Client acknowledges that JOHP may acquire or dispose of on the Client's
     behalf shares or units in any fund, company, trust or Collective Investment
     Scheme (as defined by the Rules of IMRO) under JOHP's management (or in a
     fund, company, trust or Collective Investment Scheme connected with JOHP)
     if JOHP considers such an investment to be appropriate for inclusion in or
     exclusion from the Portfolio.

CUSTODIAL SERVICES

15.  (a)  Save where the Client has notified JOHP in accordance with paragraph
          15(b), in those cases where the Client is situated in the United
          Kingdom registerable investments will be registered in the name of an
          Eligible Custodian (as defined in the Rules of IMRO) situated in the
          United Kingdom and nominated by JOHP.

     (b)  In those cases where the Client is situated overseas or where the
          Client so requests by notice in writing to JOHP, registerable
          investments will be registered in the name of an Eligible Custodian
          situated outside the United Kingdom and nominated by JOHP.

     (c)  All documents of title (including those in bearer form) will be
          retained in the custody of an Eligible Custodian nominated by JOHP and
          situated in the United Kingdom or overseas as applicable.

     (d)  None of the Eligible Custodians as aforesaid shall be Associates of
          JOHP. However, the Client's registerable investments may at any time
          be registered in the name of a nominee company which is an Associate
          of JOHP and Client's documents of title may be held by that Associate
          at any time after JOHP shall have given the Client written notice of
          its intention to do so. Such notice shall specify the nature of its

ACCOUNTS, INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS

16.  The following Client accounts, together with such others that may be
     required, will be maintained by JOHP.

     (a)  INVESTMENT ACCOUNT

          The Client's investments will be held in this account. Subject to
          paragraphs 5 and 6, JOHP shall not lend the Client's investments to
          any third party and shall not borrow money on the Client's behalf
          against the security of the Client's investments.

     (b)  CAPITAL ACCOUNT

          All uninvested cash will be held in this account by a bank chosen by
          JOHP. The account will be debited with the cost of purchases on the
          Client's behalf and with sums due and payable by the Client to JOHP
          and will be credited with the net proceeds of sales on the Client's
          behalf. Money drawn on behalf of the Client from the account shall not
          exceed the total of money held in the account on behalf of the Client
          at that time. Interest will be paid on sums standing to the credit of
          the account and held on the Client's behalf at the prevailing market
          rate. The interest will be paid quarterly and will be credited to the
          Income Account on the Client's behalf.

     (c)  SETTLEMENT ACCOUNT

          Money debited to the Capital Account in respect of the cost of
          purchases made on the Client's behalf and money received and
          receivable upon settlement of each sale made on the Client's behalf
          will be credited to this account and held there until the relevant
          settlement date.

     (d)  INCOME ACCOUNT

          Dividends and interest received on investments within the Portfolio
          will be credited to this account. Balances on the account will be paid
          away quarterly in accordance with the Client's instructions or, in the
          absence of such instructions, will be transferred quarterly to the
          Capital Account as soon as reasonably practicable after the last day
          of each such quarter being 5th April, 30th June, 5th October and 31st
          December in each year. Money drawn on behalf of the Client from the
          account shall not exceed the total of money held in the account on
          behalf of the Client at that time. Interest will not be paid on monies
          held in this account.

<PAGE>

     (d)  OFF-SHORE FUNDS

          In those cases where the Client is situated overseas or if the Client
          notifies JOHP in writing that the Client wishes cash in the Portfolio
          to be held outside the United Kingdom, JOHP will be (subject to
          applicable laws and regulations) hold such cash in a bank account
          outside the United Kingdom.

17.  The Client may at any time instruct JOHP to realize any or all of the
     investments in the Portfolio and may withdraw any sum standing to the
     credit of the Capital Account and held on the Client's behalf.

18.  JOHP shall maintain separate ledger accounts on the Client's behalf. All
     debits from and credits to the Investment Account and/or Capital Account
     and/or Income Account on the Client's behalf shall be recorded in the
     ledger accounts, and statements of account showing all transactions,
     payments and receipts up to and including 5th April of each year will be
     sent to the Client as soon as reasonably practicable after that date.

COMMUNICATIONS

19.  In the interests of proper administration of the Portfolio and for related
     investment purposes JOHP, its representatives or employees, may call upon
     the Client by telephone, visit or otherwise communicate orally with the
     Client without express invitation. The Client's attention is drawn to the
     fact that the Client will forfeit any right conferred by section 56 of the
     Financial Services Act 1986 to treat as unenforceable any investment
     agreement entered into in the course of or in consequence of such a call.

ADMINISTRATION

20.  Contract notes in respect of every purchase and sale on the Client's behalf
     will be sent to the Client before the close of business on the day next
     following the day on which the transaction was effected.

21.  JOHP will on the Client's request forward details of all transactions on
     the Client's behalf to the Client's tax advisor without additional charge.

22.  The Client may (upon giving reasonable notice) inspect all copy contract
     notes, vouchers and copies of entries in books or electronic recording
     media kept by JOHP or to which JOHP has access relating to the transactions
     effected by JOHP on the Client's behalf and those records will be
     maintained by JOHP or JOHP will ensure that they are maintained for not
     less than seven years from the date of the relevant transaction.

<PAGE>

23.  All documents will be sent to the Client at the address given above unless
     and until otherwise directed in writing. The Client agrees that it will
     immediately notify JOHP in writing of any change of address, and that JOHP
     will not be responsible for any consequences which may arise from failure
     to do so.

REVIEWS AND VALUATIONS

24.  JOHP will prepare reviews of the Portfolio incorporating an up-to-date
     valuation of each investment comprised in the Portfolio and a statement of
     the basis on which it was valued on a six monthly basis or at such other
     frequency as may be agreed between JOHP and the Client. Such reviews shall
     be prepared as at such half yearly or other dates as shall be agreed
     between JOHP and the client from time to time (each such date being
     referred to as a "Valuation Date"), and JOHP will send such reviews to the
     Client within twenty-five business days of each Valuation Date.

25.  On each Valuation Date cash will be valued at its face value and each
     investment will be valued at its middle market price on the relevant stock
     exchange at the close of business on such day or (if not a business day) on
     the nearest prior business day as is supplied by "Exshare" or any other
     suitable information service chosen by JOHP (which figures shall be binding
     save for manifest error). For the purpose of valuing in sterling any
     foreign currency or any security listed on a foreign stock exchange the
     price of which is quoted in currency other than sterling, the valuation and
     middle market exchange rates supplied by "Exshare" or any other suitable
     information service chosen by JOHP shall be applied. In the absence of that
     valuation or exchange rate, the middle market price as determined by the
     Daily Official List of The Stock Exchange or the equivalent list for any
     relevant stock exchange will be applied. If none of the foregoing methods
     of valuation are available, the investments in question will be valued in
     such other manner (by JOHP or such other person selected by JOHP) as shall
     in JOHP's opinion be fair.

26.  JOHP accepts no liability for any period longer than 25 business days
     between any Valuation Date and the despatch of a review to the Client of
     his Portfolio which has elapsed as result of any act or omission of any
     third party.

VOTING AND OTHER RIGHTS

27.  JOHP will be entitled at its discretion and without notice to the Client to
     procure or to refrain from procuring the exercise of voting and other
     rights and privileges attaching to the investments comprised in the
     Portfolio and to accede or refrain from acceding to any compromise or
     arrangement in relation to any scheme of arrangement or scheme for
     reconstruction or amalgamation involving any such investment. JOHP will not
     forward to the Client any circulars, notices or proxy cards received in
     respect of investments comprised in the Portfolio.

<PAGE>

FEES, COMMISSIONS AND EXPENSES

28.  (a)  The Client will pay a management fee to JOHP in respect of the period
          beginning with first receipt by JOHP of any investments or money from
          the Client and ending with a Valuation Date (as defined in paragraph
          24) and each period thereafter starting with the day after any
          Valuation Date and ending on the next Valuation Date (or the
          Termination Date as defined in paragraph 39 if sooner).

     (b)  The management fee shall be calculated in accordance with the 'Scale
          Rates and Charges' set out in Schedule III.

     (c)  The management fee shall be payable not later than 14 days after
          despatch to the Client of an invoice which shall be sent to the Client
          as soon as is reasonably practicable after each Valuation Date. Unless
          otherwise instructed the Client's Capital Account will be debited with
          the amounts due to JOHP on the l4th day after despatch of such
          invoice.

     (d)  In addition the Client shall reimburse JOHP for any expenses or
          liabilities which it may incur in properly carrying out its duties
          hereunder.

29.  The management fee shall be deemed to have accrued on a day-to-day basis,
     so that, if this Agreement commences or terminates other than on a
     Valuation Date (as defined in paragraph 24), the amount of the fee shall be
     duly apportioned.

30.  Commissions (as set out in Schedule III) will be payable by the Client on
     purchases and sales of investments together with all expenses including
     stamp duties, stamp duty reserve tax and VAT thereon (if applicable). The
     Client recognizes that JOHP may gain a commission benefit from dealing in a
     bulk purchase or sale on behalf of JOHP's clients, one of whom may be the
     Client, or from return commissions which benefit JOHP shall be entitled to
     retain. JOHP will be free to accept and retain as an addition to its fees
     and commissions any other commissions which it receives in the course of
     its dealing on the Client's behalf: all such benefits and receipts shall
     supplement any other remuneration receivable by JOHP in connection with
     transactions effected by JOHP with or for the Client under this or any
     other agreement with the Client and the Client consents to all such
     benefits and receipts as are referred to above without prior disclosure of
     the same to the Client on a case-by-case basis provided that JOHP
     undertakes to secure for the Client best execution of all transactions
     affected with or through a party from whom JOHP receives such benefits and
     commissions, disregarding any benefit which the Client might obtain
     directly or indirectly as a result of such arrangements.

<PAGE>

31.  JOHP shall be entitled to alter the manner of computing or charging its
     fees, commissions and expenses or of paying interest on the money held on
     the Client's behalf in the Capital Account (including with prejudice to the
     generality of the foregoing its scale rates and charges) by giving one
     month's prior notice in writing to the Client.

RESPONSIBILITY AND INSURANCE

32.  JOHP will indemnify the Client in respect of any loss incurred as a result
     of negligence, wilful default or fraud by JOHP or any of its employees.
     Subject to the above, JOHP will not be responsible or liable for any claim,
     loss, damage, expense or costs arising by reason of any of the following:

     (a)  any investment decision taken and acted upon in accordance with the
          terms of this Agreement; or

     (b)  any delay or default in the performance of its obligations under this
          Agreement arising in consequence of any event or circumstance beyond
          the reasonable control of JOHP; or

     (c)  any act or omission on the part of any of the banks or nominee
          companies controlled by them or other eligible custodians as referred
          to in paragraph 15 or any other person to which any of them shall have
          delegated its function or on the part of any other third party
          whatsoever; or

     (d)  any consequential loss suffered in consequence of any act or omission
          of JOHP or any breach of JOHP of any term of this Agreement.

33.  The Client agrees to indemnify and keep indemnified JOHP from and against
     all demands, claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses
     whatsoever incurred by JOHP arising out of the breach by the Client of any
     warranty or by reason of any failure by the Client to comply with and/or
     perform any of the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement.

34.  Where the Client is a joint account (whether or not a trust account) JOHP
     shall unless and until otherwise directed in writing by all the persons
     named in the joint account, be entitled to act on the instructions of any
     of them and shall not in any whatsoever be liable to the others for doing
     so.

<PAGE>

35.  JOHP has effected insurance to provide for the protection of the Client
     against losses arising from any negligence of JOHP or any dishonesty of
     employees of JOHP.

36.  Under Section 54 of the Financial Services Act 1986 The Securities and
     Investments Board has established a scheme for compensating investors by
     which the Client may be entitled to compensation in the event of JOHP's
     inability to meet any liabilities to the Client. JOHP will make available
     to the Client upon request a statement describing the Client's rights to
     compensation under the scheme.

DELEGATION AND USE OF AGENTS

37.  JOHP may delegate any of its functions under this Agreement to an Associate
     and may provide information about the Client and the Portfolio to any such
     Associate but JOHP's liability to the Client for all matters so delegated
     shall not be affected thereby. JOHP shall give to the Client written notice
     of any delegation of a function which involves the exercise of its
     discretionary investment management powers.

38.  JOHP may employ agents (including Associates) to perform any
     administrative, dealing, custodial and ancillary services required to
     enable JOHP to perform its services under this Agreement. JOHP undertakes
     to act in good faith and with due diligence in the choice and use of such
     agents.

TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT

39.  This Agreement may be terminated by either party by giving written notice
     of termination to the other at any time. Termination shall take effect on
     the day upon which the other party actually receives the notice (the
     "Termination Date") provided that, where the client is a joint account,
     notice of termination by JOHP shall be given to every person named in the
     joint account and in such circumstances the Termination Date shall be
     deemed to be the day after the date of posting by first class recorded
     delivery or other appropriate means to all persons named in the joint
     account.

40.  Upon the Termination Date, JOHP will complete expeditiously all
     transactions in progress at termination but will not execute any further
     transactions for the Client. Upon all fees, commissions, expenses and other
     sums due to it and any other liabilities for which it may be or become
     liable in connection with the management of the Portfolio being settled or
     adequately secured to the satisfaction of JOHP, JOHP will ensure that all
     investments and cash balances held on the Client's behalf will, after any
     outstanding security registration, stock exchange settlements and other
     administrative matters have been completed and as soon as reasonably
     practicable, be transferred to the Client or dealt with in accordance with
     the Client's instructions, in all cases at the cost of the Client.

<PAGE>

41.  Termination will not affect accrued rights, existing commitments or any
     contractual provision intended to survive termination and will be without
     penalty or other additional payment except that JOHP may charge the Client
     an amount equal to:

     (a)  the relevant proportion of the management fee, corresponding to that
          part of the period ending on a Valuation Date by reference to which
          fees are payable, which has expired when this Agreement is terminated;

     (b)  any additional expenses which JOHP necessarily incurs in terminating
          this Agreement; and

     (c)  any losses necessarily realized in settling or concluding outstanding
          obligations.

42.  The death, bankruptcy or other incapacity or, in the case of a body
     corporate, the cessation of business of the Client or a petition being
     presented or a meeting being convened to consider a resolution for the
     liquidation of the Client shall not of itself terminate JOHP's appointment;
     but JOHP may at its discretion treat its receipt of actual notice of any
     such events as if it were a written notice of termination from the Client.

43.  If the Client is a joint account the Client's obligations under this
     Agreement shall be joint and several. On the death of any of the persons
     constituting the Client (being survived by any such other person), the
     Agreement shall not terminate and, except in the case of trustees, the
     interest of the deceased in the Portfolio shall automatically enure to the
     benefit of the survivor(s) unless otherwise specified by notice in writing
     to JOHP.

CLIENT WARRANTIES

44.  The Client warrants that the Client is the beneficial owner (or the duly
     authorized agent of the beneficial owner) of the whole of the Portfolio
     free from all liens, charges, encumbrances and restrictions on transfer
     except insofar as advised by the Client to JOHP, and will so remain during
     the currency of this Agreement.

45.  The Client warrants that the Client is empowered to enter into this
     Agreement without the consent or authority of any other party and in the
     case of a Client being a body corporate the Client warrants that by
     entering into this Agreement it is not nor will it be in breach of its
     Memorandum or Articles of Association or any other relevant document.

GENERAL

46.  Terms and expressions defined in the rules of IMRO for the time being in
     force shall where the context so admits bear the same meaning in this
     Agreement.

<PAGE>

47.  The Clause headings in this Agreement are included for ease of reference
     only and shall not affect its interpretation.

48.  The Schedules to this Agreement are an integral part of it.

49.  If the Client is an individual this Agreement shall be binding on his legal
     personal representatives.

50.  This Agreement is personal to the parties hereto and shall not be capable
     of assignment.

51.  Subject to clause 31, no change, alteration or modification to this
     Agreement or the Schedules hereto shall be made unless in writing and
     signed by the parties hereto.

52.  Notice required or authorized to be served hereunder must be addressed to
     the address of the recipient stated above or to such other address as may
     have been notified in writing by either party hereto to the other as its
     address for the service of notices. In the case of notice served by the
     Client from outside the United Kingdom and of notice served upon the Client
     at an address outside the United Kingdom, the notice shall be sufficiently
     served if served by pre-paid letter, cable or telex. In the case of notice
     service by the Client from within the United Kingdom and of notice served
     upon the Client at an address within the United Kingdom the notice shall be
     sufficiently served if served by pre-paid letter.

53.  If the Client makes a complaint to JOHP verbally or in writing about any
     service JOHP has rendered to the Client under this Agreement the complaint
     shall immediately be referred to JOHP's Chief Executive or to a Senior
     Investment Manager who was not involved in the circumstances relating to
     the complaint and who will investigate such circumstances. Upon the
     conclusion of this investigation he shall make a written report to the
     Client and take any action he deems necessary to rectify the matter which
     is the subject of the complaint. The Client has the right to refer any
     complaint to IMRO if the Client is not satisfied with the action taken by
     the Chief Executive or Senior Investment Manager, and in any event has the
     right to make the complaint direct to IMRO or the Investment Ombudsman
     without prior reference to JOHP.

54.  Each party to this Agreement shall respect and protect the confidentiality
     of information acquired in consequence of it and shall not disclose such
     information to any third party save in the course of giving effect to this
     Agreement or as may be required by law, or where requested by regulatory
     authorities, or to their professional advisors where reasonably necessary
     for the performance of their professional services.

                                  THE PORTFOLIO

                     Valuation and composition of Portfolio
           (see attached letter/opening valuation - where applicable)


                                   SCHEDULE II

                 INVESTMENT POLICY, GUIDELINES AND RESTRICTIONS

                   PART I - Investment Policy including basis
                          of measurement of performance

The investment objectives are to maintain a maximum total return commensurate
with safety and the protection of the underlying value of the capital of the
fund.


The performance will be measured against the F.T. All Share Index, any other
appropriate Index or measure of performance agreed upon by JOHP and the Client.



                      PART II - Guidelines and Restrictions

1.   There will be no restrictions placed on the types of investment in which
     the money comprised in the Portfolio will be invested provided that the
     services to be provided by JOHP will not include advising on or effecting
     Contingent Liability Transactions, nor will they, without the express
     authority of the Client, relate to options, futures or contracts for
     differences (or to any right or interest in such investments).


2.   The contents of the Portfolio may be invested in any market save for the
     following:


     There shall be no restriction on the amount of monies or proportion of the
     Portfolio invested in any one investment or type of investment permitted
     hereunder provided that, subject to the provisions relating to overdraft
     contained in paragraph 6 of this Agreement, under no circumstances will
     JOHP make investments on behalf of the Client to a value in excess of the
     aggregate of the value of the funds and securities held by JOHP on behalf
     of the Client in the accounts referred to in paragraph 16 of this
     Agreement.

<PAGE>

             PART III - Risk Warnings and Risk Disclosure Statement

                  Investments Denominated in Foreign Currencies

If a liability of the Client in one currency is to be matched by an asset in a
different currency, or if JOHP provides services under this Agreement relating
to an investment denominated in a foreign currency, a movement in exchange rates
may have an effect which may be either favorable or unfavorable on the
investment, which effect may be separate from the gain or loss otherwise
experienced on such investment.

                       Investments not readily realisable

Certain categories of investments comprised in the Portfolio may not be readily
realisable. You should be aware that there can be no certainty that market
makers or brokers will be prepared to deal in such investments and that proper
information for determining their current value may not be available.

                                    Warrants

A warrant is a right to subscribe for shares, debentures, loan stock or
government securities, and is exercisable against the original issuer of the
securities. Warrants often involve a high degree of gearing so that a relatively
small movement in the price of the underlying security results in a
disproportionately large movement, unfavorable as well as favorable, in the
price of the warrant. The prices of warrants can therefore be volatile.

                                  Stabilisation

This statement is made in compliance with Rule 14 of Chapter IV of the rules of
IMRO.

"We or our representatives may from time to time effect on your behalf or
recommend to you transactions in securities which are the subject of a recent
new issue where the price of those transactions may have been influenced by bids
made or transactions effected for the purpose of stabilising the price of those
securities. You should read the explanation below carefully. Its purpose is to
enable you to judge whether you wish your funds to be invested at all in such
securities, or, if so, whether you wish to authorize us generally to effect
transactions in such securities on your behalf without further reference to you
or whether you wish to be consulted before any particular transaction is
effected on your behalf.

<PAGE>

Stabilisation is a process whereby the market price of a security is pegged or
fixed during the period in which a new issue of securities is sold to the
public. Stabilisation may take place in the new issue or in other securities
related to the new issue in such a way that the price of the other securities
may affect the price of the new issue or vice versa.

The reason stabilisation is permitted is that when a new issue is brought to
market the sudden glut will sometimes force the price lower for a period of time
before buyers are found for the securities on offer.

As long as he obeys a strict set of rules the "stabilising manager", normally
the issuing house chiefly responsible for bringing a new issue to market, is
entitled to buy securities in the market that he has previously sold to
investors or allotted to institutions who were included in the new issue but who
have decided not to continue participating. The effect of this may be to keep
the price at a higher level than would otherwise be the case during the period
of stabilising.

The rules limit the period in which he may stabilise, fix the price at which he
may stabilize (in the case of shares and warrants but not bonds), and require
him to disclose that he may be (but not that he is) stabilising.

The fact that a new issue or a related security is being stabilized does not in
itself mean that investors are not interested in the issue, but neither should
the existence of transactions in an issue where stabilising may take place be
relied upon as an indication that investors are interested in the new issue or
interested in purchasing at the price at which transactions are taking place".

             REGULATED BY IMRO IN THE CONDUCT OF INVESTMENT BUSINESS

THIS INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT IS MADE THE      DAY OF         19

BETWEEN:

(1)  JO HAMBRO & PARTNERS LIMITED ("JOHP") a member of the Investment Management
     Regulatory Organization Limited ("IMRO") and regulated in the conduct of
     investment business by it, whose registered office is at 10 Park Place,
     London SW1A 1LP; and

(2)  Peak Investments
     -------------------------------------------         (portfolio name)

     (hereafter known as the "Client")

     of 3 Chester Street, London SWIX 7BB
     -------------------------------------------

     -------------------------------------------                (address)

NOW IT IS HEREBY AGREED as follows:

APPOINTMENT AND STATUS OF CLIENT

1.   The Client, a Private Customer as defined in the Rules of IMRO, hereby
     appoints JOHP to act as discretionary investment manager, subject to the
     terms and conditions hereof, in relation to the Client's investments and
     cash which are from time to time placed under the management of JOHP (the
     "Portfolio") and JOHP hereby agrees to manage and administer the Portfolio.
     The appointment will commence on the date on which this Agreement is
     delivered to JOHP by the Client having been signed first by the Client then
     by JOHP. The assets comprising the Portfolio and their opening value are
     set out in Schedule 1.

MANAGEMENT OF INVESTMENTS

2.   JOHP shall have complete discretion, power and authority to manage the
     Portfolio and to make investments and changes in investments on the
     Client's behalf and as the Client's agent within the investment policy
     agreed between JOHP and the Client and set out in Part 1 of Schedule II.
     Such policy shall be subject to the guidelines and restrictions set out in
     Part II of Schedule II and to any guidelines, restrictions and instructions
     specified in writing from time to time by the Client or by the Client's
     duly authorized agent (written notice of whose authority shall have been
     received by JOHP). The Client's attention is specifically drawn to the
     warnings set out in Part III of Schedule II.

<PAGE>

3.   JOHP shall not be obliged to undertake the management of investments the
     management of which would in its opinion be onerous to it.

DEALING TERMS

4.   Subject as set out in paragraph 9, in effecting transactions for the
     Portfolio JOHP shall seek best execution at all times and may (subject to
     the investment policy set out in Part I of Schedule II) deal on such
     markets or exchanges and with such counterparties as it thinks fit. The
     Client agrees that all such transactions will be effected in accordance
     with the rules and regulations of the relevant market or exchange and that
     JOHP may take all such steps as may be required or permitted by such rules
     and regulations and/or by good market practice.

5.   The Client's investments or documents of title or certificates evidencing
     title to investments or any other property belonging to the Client will not
     be lent by JOHP to a third party except as otherwise agreed between the
     Client and JOHP in writing.

6.   JOHP may supplement the funds in the Portfolio by borrowing on the Client's
     behalf but only for the purpose of funding short-term deficiencies arising
     in the normal course of JOHP's duties hereunder to an extent which is not
     material in the context of the Portfolio taken as a whole. JOHP will not
     borrow money on the Client's behalf against the security of any of the
     Client's investments, documents of title or property.

7.   JOHP may commit the Client to underwrite any issue or offer for sale of
     securities without the Client's prior written consent.

8.   JOHP may act as principal in any transaction for the Client provided that
     JOHP shall secure for the Client best execution of such transaction.

9.   Subject to the IMRO Rules, JOHP may, without prior reference to the Client,
     enter into a transaction on behalf of more than one client collectively.

10.  JOHP has the right under this Agreement to effect transactions on the
     Client's behalf in investments the price of which may be being stabilized.
     The attention of the Client is referred to the statement contained in
     Schedule II relating to stabilization. Signature of this Agreement by or on
     behalf of the Client shall act as acknowledgment by the Client of receipt
     of such statement prior to entry into this Agreement.

<PAGE>

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

11.  Subject to paragraphs 12 and 13, JOHP shall not undertake any transactions
     on the Client's behalf in which JOHP has directly or indirectly a material
     interest or have any relationship with another party which may involve a
     conflict with JOHP's duty to the Client unless that interest or
     relationship is disclosed in writing to the Client.

12.  The Client's Portfolio may contain securities of which the issue or offer
     for sale is underwritten, managed or arranged by an Associate (as defined
     in the Rules of IMRO) of JOHP during the preceding twelve months.

13.  The Client understands that JOHP's directors or staff may from time to time
     hold shares or securities including holdings that may be in the Portfolio,
     and that JOHP's directors or staff may from time to time be directors of
     companies whose shares are held in the Portfolio.

14.  The Client acknowledges that JOHP may acquire or dispose of on the Client's
     behalf shares or units in any fund, company, trust or Collective Investment
     Scheme (as defined by the Rules of IMRO) under JOHP's management (or in a
     fund, company, trust or Collective Investment Scheme connected with JOHP)
     if JOHP considers such an investment to be appropriate for inclusion in or
     exclusion from the Portfolio.

CUSTODIAL SERVICES

15.  (a)  Save where the Client has notified JOHP in accordance with paragraph
          15(b), in those cases where the Client is situated in the United
          Kingdom registerable investments will be registered in the name of an
          Eligible Custodian (as defined in the Rules of IMRO) situated in the
          United Kingdom and nominated by JOHP.

     (b)  In those cases where the Client is situated overseas or where the
          Client so requests by notice in writing to JOHP, registerable
          investments will be registered in the name of an Eligible Custodian
          situated outside the United Kingdom and nominated by JOHP.

     (c)  All documents of title (including those in bearer form) will be
          retained in the custody of an Eligible Custodian nominated by JOHP and
          situated in the United Kingdom or overseas as applicable.

     (d)  None of the Eligible Custodians as aforesaid shall be Associates of
          JOHP. However, the Client's registerable investments may at any time
          be registered in the name of a nominee company which is an Associate
          of JOHP and Client's documents of title may be held by that Associate
          at any time after JOHP shall have given the Client written notice of
          its intention to do so. Such notice shall specify the nature of its
          association with such Associate.

<PAGE>

ACCOUNTS, INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS

16.  The following Client accounts, together with such others that may be
     required, will be maintained by JOHP.

     (a)  INVESTMENT ACCOUNT

          The Client's investments will be held in this account. Subject to
          paragraphs 5 and 6, JOHP shall not lend the Client's investments to
          any third party and shall not borrow money on the Client's behalf
          against the security of the Client's investments.

     (b)  CAPITAL ACCOUNT

          All uninvested cash will be held in this account by a bank chosen by
          JOHP. The account will be debited with the cost of purchases on the
          Client's behalf and with sums due and payable by the Client to JOHP
          and will be credited with the net proceeds of sales on the Client's
          behalf. Money drawn on behalf of the Client from the account shall not
          exceed the total of money held in the account on behalf of the Client
          at that time. Interest will be paid on sums standing to the credit of
          the account and held on the Client's behalf at the prevailing market
          rate. The interest will be paid quarterly and will be credited to the
          Income Account on the Client's behalf.

     (c)  SETTLEMENT ACCOUNT

          Money debited to the Capital Account in respect of the cost of
          purchases made on the Client's behalf and money received and
          receivable upon settlement of each sale made on the Client's behalf
          will be credited to this account and held there until the relevant
          settlement date.

     (d)  INCOME ACCOUNT

          Dividends and interest received on investments within the Portfolio
          will be credited to this account. Balances on the account will be paid
          away quarterly in accordance with the Client's instructions or, in the
          absence of such instructions, will be transferred quarterly to the
          Capital Account as soon as reasonably practicable after the last day
          of each such quarter being 5th April, 30th June, 5th October and 31st
          December in each year. Money drawn on behalf of the Client from the
          account shall not exceed the total of money held in the account on
          behalf of the Client at that time. Interest will not be paid on monies
          held in this account.

<PAGE>

     (e)  OFF-SHORE FUNDS

          In those cases where the Client is situated overseas or if the Client
          notifies JOHP in writing that the Client wishes cash in the Portfolio
          to be held outside the United Kingdom, JOHP will be (subject to
          applicable laws and regulations) hold such cash in a bank account
          outside the United Kingdom

17.  The Client may at any time instruct JOHP to realise any or all of the
     investments in the Portfolio and may withdraw any sum standing to the
     credit of the Capital Account and held on the Client's behalf.

18.  JOHP shall maintain separate ledger accounts on the Client's behalf. All
     debits from and credits to the Investment Account and/or Capital Account
     and/or Income Account on the Client's behalf shall be recorded in the
     ledger accounts, and statements of account showing all transactions,
     payments and receipts up to and including 5th April of each year will be
     sent to the Client as soon as reasonably practicable after that date.

COMMUNICATIONS

19.  In the interests of proper administration of the Portfolio and for related
     investment purposes JOHP, its representatives or employees, may call upon
     the Client by telephone, visit or otherwise communicate orally with the
     Client without express invitation. The Client's attention is drawn to the
     fact that the Client will forfeit any right conferred by section 56 of the
     Financial Services Act 1986 to treat as unenforceable any investment
     agreement entered into in the course of or in consequence of such a call.

ADMINISTRATION

20.  Contract notes in respect of every purchase and sale on the Client's behalf
     will be sent to the Client before the close of business on the day next
     following the day on which the transaction was effected.

21.  JOHP will on the Client's request forward details of all transactions on
     the Client's behalf to the Client's tax advisor without additional charge.

22.  The Client may (upon giving reasonable notice) inspect all copy contract
     notes, vouchers and copies of entries in books or electronic recording
     media kept by JOHP or to which JOHP has access relating to the transactions
     effected by JOHP on the Client's behalf and those records will be
     maintained by JOHP or JOHP will ensure that they are maintained for not
     less than seven years from the date of the relevant transaction.

<PAGE>

23.  All documents will be sent to the Client at the address given above unless
     and until otherwise directed in writing. The Client agrees that it will
     immediately notify JOHP in writing of any changes of address, and that JOHP
     will not be responsible for any consequences which may arise from failure
     to do so.

REVIEWS AND VALUATIONS

24.  JOHP will prepare reviews of the Portfolio incorporating an up-to-date
     valuation of each investment comprised in the Portfolio and a statement of
     the basis on which it was valued on a six monthly basis or at such other
     frequency as may be agreed between JOHP and the Client. Such reviews shall
     be prepared as at such half yearly or other dates as shall be agreed
     between JOHP and the Client from time to time (each such date being
     referred to as a "Valuation Date"), and JOHP will send such reviews to the
     Client within twenty-five business days of each Valuation Date.

25.  On each Valuation Date cash will be valued at its face value and each
     investment will be valued at its middle market price on the relevant stock
     exchange at the close of business on such day or (if not a business day) on
     the nearest prior business day as is supplied by "Exshare" or any other
     suitable information service chosen by JOHP (which figures shall be binding
     save for manifest error). For the purpose of valuing in sterling any
     foreign currency or any security listed on a foreign stock exchange the
     price of which is quoted in currency other than sterling, the valuation and
     middle market exchange rates supplied by "Exshare" or any other suitable
     information service chosen by JOHP shall be applied. In the absence of that
     valuation or exchange rate, the middle market price as determined by the
     Daily Official List of The Stock Exchange or the equivalent list for any
     relevant stock exchange will be applied. If none of the foregoing methods
     of valuation are available, the investments in question will be valued in
     such other manner (by JOHP or such other person selected by JOHP) as shall
     in JOHP's opinion be fair.

26.  JOHP accepts no liability for any period longer than 25 business days
     between any Valuation Date and the despatch of a review to the Client of
     his Portfolio which has elapsed as a result of any act or omission of any
     third party.

VOTING AND OTHER RIGHTS

27.  JOHP will be entitled at its discretion and without notice to the Client to
     procure or to refrain from procuring the exercise of voting and other
     rights and privileges attaching to the investments comprised in the
     Portfolio and to accede or refrain from acceding to any compromise or
     arrangement in relation to any scheme of arrangement or scheme for
     reconstruction or amalgamation involving any such investment. JOHP will not
     forward to the Client any circulars, notices or proxy cards received in
     respect of investments comprised in the Portfolio.

<PAGE>

FEES, COMMISSIONS AND EXPENSES

28.  (a)  The Client will pay a management fee to JOHP in respect of the period
          beginning with first receipt by JOHP of any investments or money from
          the Client and ending with a Valuation Date (as defined in paragraph
          24) and each period thereafter starting with the day after any
          Valuation Date and ending on the next Valuation Date (or the
          Termination Date as defined in paragraph 39 if sooner).

     (b)  The management fee shall be calculated in accordance with the 'Scale
          Rates and Charges' set out in Schedule III.

     (c)  The management fee shall be payable not later than 14 days after
          despatch to the Client of an invoice which shall be sent to the Client
          as soon as is reasonably practicable after each Valuation Date. Unless
          otherwise instructed the Client's Capital Account will be debited with
          the amounts due to JOHP on the 14th day after despatch of such
          invoice.

     (d)  In addition the Client shall reimburse JOHP for any expenses or
          liabilities which it may incur in properly carrying out its duties
          hereunder.

29.  The management fee shall be deemed to have accrued on a day-to-day basis,
     so that, if this Agreement commences or terminates other than on a
     Valuation Date (as defined in paragraph 24), the amount of the fee shall be
     duly apportioned.

30.  Commissions (as set out in Schedule III) will be payable by the Client on
     purchases and sales of investments together with all expenses including
     stamp duties, stamp duty reserve tax and VAT thereon (if applicable). The
     Client recognises that JOHP may gain a commission benefit from dealing in a
     bulk purchase or sale on behalf of JOHP's clients, one of whom may be the
     Client, or from return commissions which benefit JOHP shall be entitled to
     retain. JOHP will be free to accept and retain as an addition to its fees
     and commissions any other commissions which it receives in the course of
     its dealing on the Client's behalf: all such benefits and receipts shall
     supplement any other remuneration receivable by JOHP in connection with
     transactions effected by JOHP with or for the Client under this or any
     other agreement with the Client and the Client consents to all such
     benefits and receipts as are referred to above without prior disclosure of
     the same to the Client on a case-by-case basis provided that JOHP
     undertakes to secure for the Client best execution of all transactions
     effected with or through a party from whom JOHP receives such benefits and
     commissions, disregarding any benefit which the Client might obtain
     directly or indirectly as a result of such arrangements.

<PAGE>

31.  JOHP shall be entitled to alter the manner of computing or charging its
     fees, commissions and expenses or of paying interest on the money held on
     the Client's behalf in the Capital Account (including with prejudice to the
     generality of the foregoing its scale rates and charges) by giving one
     month's prior notice in writing to the Client.

RESPONSIBILITY AND INSURANCE

32.  JOHP will indemnify the Client in respect of any loss incurred as a result
     of negligence, wilful default or fraud by JOHP or any of its employees.
     Subject to the above, JOHP will not be responsible or liable for any claim,
     loss, damage, expense or costs arising by reason of any of the following:

     (a)  any investment decision taken and acted upon in accordance with the
          terms of this Agreement; or

     (b)  any delay or default in the performance of its obligations under this
          Agreement arising in consequence of any event or circumstance beyond
          the reasonable control of JOHP; or

     (c)  any act or omission on the part of any of the banks or nominee
          companies controlled by them or other eligible custodians as referred
          to in paragraph 15 or any other person to which any of them shall have
          delegated its function or on the part of any other third party
          whatsoever; or

     (d)  any consequential loss suffered in consequence of any act or omission
          of JOHP or any breach of JOHP of any term of this Agreement.

33.  The Client agrees to indemnify and keep indemnified JOHP from and against
     all demands, claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses
     whatsoever incurred by JOHP arising out of the breach by the Client of any
     warranty or by reason of any failure by the Client to comply with and/or
     perform any of the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement.

34.  Where the Client is a joint account (whether or not a trust account) JOHP
     shall unless and until otherwise directed in writing by all the persons
     named in the joint account, be entitled to act on the instructions of any
     of them and shall not in any whatsoever be liable to the others for doing
     so.

<PAGE>

35.  JOHP has effected insurance to provide for the protection of the Client
     against losses arising from any negligence of JOHP or any dishonesty of
     employees of JOHP.

36.  Under Section 54 of the Financial Services Act 1986 The Securities and
     Investments Board has established a scheme for compensating investors by
     which the Client may be entitled to compensation in the event of JOHP's
     inability to meet any liabilities to the Client. JOHP will make available
     to the Client upon request a statement describing the Client's rights to
     compensation under the scheme.

DELEGATION AND USE OF AGENTS

37.  JOHP may delegate any of its functions under this Agreement to an Associate
     and may provide information about the Client and the Portfolio to any such
     Associate but JOHP's liability to the Client for all matters so delegated
     shall not be affected thereby. JOHP shall give to the Client written notice
     of any delegation of a function which involves the exercise of its
     discretionary investment management powers.

38.  JOHP may employ agents (including Associates) to perform any
     administrative, dealing, custodial and ancillary services required to
     enable JOHP to perform its services under this Agreement. JOHP undertakes
     to act in good faith and with due diligence in the choice and use of such
     agents.

TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT

39.  This Agreement may be terminated by either party by giving written notice
     of termination to the other at any time. Termination shall take effect on
     the day upon which the other party actually receives the notice (the
     "Termination Date") provided that, where the Client is a joint account,
     notice of termination by JOHP shall be given to every person named in the
     joint account and in such circumstances the Termination Date shall be
     deemed to be the day after the date of posting by first class recorded
     delivery or other appropriate means to all persons named in the joint
     account.

40.  Upon the Termination Date, JOHP will complete expeditiously all
     transactions in progress at termination but will not execute any further
     transactions for the Client. Upon all fees, commissions, expenses and other
     sums due to it and any other liabilities for which it may be or become
     liable in connection with the management of the Portfolio being settled or
     adequately secured to the satisfaction of JOHP, JOHP will ensure that all
     investments and cash balances held on the Client's behalf will, after any
     outstanding security registration, stock exchange settlements and other
     administrative matters have been completed and as soon as reasonably
     practicable, be transferred to the Client or dealt with in accordance with
     the Client's instructions, in all cases at the cost of the Client.

<PAGE>

41.  Termination will not affect accrued rights, existing commitments or any
     contractual provision intended to survive termination and will be without
     penalty or other additional payment except that JOHP may charge the Client
     an amount equal to:

     (a)  the relevant proportion of the management fee, corresponding to that
          part of the period ending on a Valuation Date by reference to which
          fees are payable, which has expired when this Agreement is terminated;

     (b)  any additional expenses which JOHP necessarily incurs in terminating
          this Agreement; and

     (c)  any losses necessarily realised in settling or concluding outstanding
          obligations.

42.  The death, bankruptcy or other incapacity or, in the case of a body
     corporate, the cessation of business of the Client or a petition being
     presented or a meeting being convened to consider a resolution for the
     liquidation of the Client shall not of itself terminate JOHP's appointment;
     but JOHP may at its discretion treat its receipt of actual notice of any
     such events as if it were a written notice of termination from the Client.

43.  If the Client is a joint account the Client's obligations under this
     Agreement shall be joint and several. On the death of any of the persons
     constituting the Client (being survived by any such other person), the
     Agreement shall not terminate and, except in the case of trustees, the

                                  THE PORTFOLIO

                     Valuation and composition of Portfolio
           (see attached letter/opening valuation - where applicable)


                                   SCHEDULE II

                 INVESTMENT POLICY, GUIDELINES AND RESTRICTIONS

                   PART I - Investment Policy including basis
                          of measurement of performance

The investment objectives are to maintain a maximum total return commensurate
with safety and the protection of the underlying value of the capital of the
fund.



The performance will be measured against the F.T. All Share Index, any other
appropriate Index or measure of performance agreed upon by JOHP and the Client.


                      PART II - Guidelines and Restrictions

1.   There will be no restrictions placed on the types of investment in which
     the money comprised in the Portfolio will be invested provided that the
     services to be provided by JOHP will not include advising on or effecting
     Contingent Liability Transactions, nor will they, without the express prior
     authority of the Client, relate to options, futures or contracts for
     differences (or to any right or interest in such investments).


2.   The contents of the Portfolio may be invested in any market save for the
     following.


     There shall be no restriction on the amount of monies or proportion of the
     Portfolio invested in any one investment or type of investment permitted
     hereunder provided that, subject to the provisions relating to overdraft
     contained in paragraph 6 of this Agreement, under no circumstances will
     JOHP make investments on behalf of the Client to a value in excess of the
     aggregate of the value of the funds and securities held by JOHP on behalf
     of the Client in the accounts referred to in paragraph 16 of this
     Agreement.

<PAGE>

             PART III - Risk Warnings and Risk Disclosure Statement


                  Investments Denominated in Foreign Currencies

If a liability of the Client in one currency is to be matched by an asset in a
different currency, or if JOHP provides services under this Agreement relating
to an investment denominated in a foreign currency, a movement in exchange rates
may have an effect which may be either favourable or unfavourable on the
investment, which effect may be separate from the gain or loss otherwise
experienced on such investment.

                       Investments not readily realisable

Certain categories of investments comprised in the Portfolio may not be readily
realisable. You should be aware that there can be no certainty that market
makers or brokers will be prepared to deal in such investments and that proper
information for determining their current value may not be available.

                                    Warrants

A warrant is a right to subscribe for shares, debentures, loan stock or
government securities, and is exercisable against the original issuer of the
securities. Warrants often involve a high degree of gearing so that a relatively
small movement in the price of the underlying security results in a
disproportionately large movement, unfavourable as well as favourable, in the
price of the warrant. The prices of warrants can therefore be volatile.

                                  Stabilisation

This statement is made in compliance with Rule 14 of Chapter IV of the rules of
IMRO.

"We or our representatives may from time to time effect on your behalf or
recommend to you transactions in securities which are the subject of a recent
new issue where the price of those transactions may have been influenced by bids
made or transactions effected for the purpose of stabilising the price of those
securities. You should read the explanation below carefully. Its purpose is to
enable you to judge whether you wish your funds to be invested at all in such
securities or, if so, whether you wish to authorise us generally to effect
transactions in such securities on your behalf without further reference to you
or whether you wish to be consulted before any particular transaction is
effected on your behalf.

Stabilisation is a process whereby the market price of a security is pegged or
fixed during the period in which a new issue of securities is sold to the
public. Stabilisation may take place in the new issue or in other securities
related to the new issue in such a way that the price of the other securities
may affect the price of the new issue or vice versa.

<PAGE>

The reason stabilisation is permitted is that when a new issue is brought to
market the sudden glut will sometimes force the price lower for a period of time
before buyers are found for the securities on offer.

As long as he obeys a strict set of rules the "stabilising manager", normally
the issuing house chiefly responsible for bringing a new issue to market, is
entitled to buy securities in the market that he has previously sold to
investors or allotted to institutions who were included in the new issue but who
have decided not to continue participating. The effect of this may be to keep
the price at a higher level than would otherwise be the case during the period
of stabilising.

The rules limit the period in which he may stabilise, fix the price at which he
may stabilise (in the case of shares and warrants but not bonds), and require
him to disclose that he may be (but not that he is) stabilising.

The fact that a new issue or a related security is being stabilised does not in
itself mean that investors are not interested in the issue, but neither should
the existence of transactions in an issue where stabilising may take place be
relied upon as an indication that investors are interested in the new issue or
interested in purchasing at the price at which transactions are taking place".

                ---------------------------------------------------
         Basingstoke, Hamps RG21 2SZ                                 (address)
         ----------------------------------------------------------

NOW IT IS HEREBY AGREED as follows:

APPOINTMENT AND STATUS OF CLIENT

1.       The Client, a Private Customer as defined in the Rules of IMRO, hereby
         appoints JOHP to act as discretionary investment manager, subject to
         the terms and conditions hereof, in relation to the Client's
         investments and cash which are from time to time placed under the
         management of JOHP (the "Portfolio") and JOHP hereby agrees to manage
         and administer the Portfolio. The appointment will commence on the date
         on which this Agreement is delivered to JOHP by the Client having been
         signed first by the Client then by JOHP. The assets comprising the
         Portfolio and their opening value are set out in Schedule 1.

MANAGEMENT OF INVESTMENTS

2.       JOHP shall have complete discretion, power and authority to manage the
         Portfolio and to make investments and changes in investments on the
         Client's behalf and as the Client's agent within the investment policy
         agreed between JOHP and the Client and set out in Part I of Schedule
         II. Such policy shall be subject to the guidelines and restrictions set
         out in Part II of Schedule II and to any guidelines, restrictions and
         instructions specified in writing from time to time by the Client or by
         the Client's duly authorised agent (written notice of whose authority
         shall have been received by JOHP.) The Client's attention is
         specifically drawn to the warnings set out in Part III of Schedule II.

<PAGE>
3.       JOHP shall not be obliged to undertake the management of investments
         the management of which would in its opinion be onerous to it.

DEALING TERMS

4.       Subject as set out in paragraph 9, in effecting transactions for the
         Portfolio JOHP shall seek best execution at all times and may (subject
         to the investment policy set out in Part I of Schedule II) deal on such
         markets or exchanges and with such counterparties as it thinks fit. The
         Client agrees that all such transactions will be effected in accordance
         with the rules and regulations of the relevant market or exchange and
         that JOHP may take all such steps as may be required or permitted by
         such rules and regulations and/or by good market practice.

5.       The Client's investments or documents of title or certificates
         evidencing title to investments or any other property belonging to the
         Client will not be lent by JOHP to a third party except as otherwise
         agreed between the Client and JOHP in writing.

6.       JOHP may supplement the funds in the Portfolio by borrowing on the
         Client's behalf but only for the purpose of funding short-term
         deficiencies arising in the normal course of JOHP's duties hereunder to
         an extent which is not material in the context of the Portfolio taken
         as a whole. JOHP will not borrow money on the Client's behalf against
         the security of any of the Client's investments, documents of title or
         property.

7.       JOHP may commit the Client to underwrite any issue or offer for sale of
         securities without the Client's prior written consent.

8.       JOHP may act as principal in any transaction for the Client provided
         that JOHP shall secure for the Client best execution of such
         transaction.

9.       Subject to the IMRO Rules, JOHP may, without prior reference to the
         Client, enter into a transaction on behalf of more than one client
         collectively.

10.      JOHP has the right under this Agreement to effect transactions on the
         Client's behalf in investments the price of which may be being
         stabilised. The attention of the Client is referred to the statement
         contained in Schedule II relating to stabilisation. Signature of this
         Agreement by or on behalf of the Client shall act as acknowledgment by
         the Client of receipt of such statement prior to entry into this
         Agreement.

<PAGE>
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

11.      Subject to paragraphs 12 and 13, JOHP shall not undertake any
         transactions on the Client's behalf in which JOHP has directly or
         indirectly a material interest or have any relationship with another
         party which may involve a conflict with JOHP's duty to the Client
         unless that interest or relationship is disclosed in writing to the
         Client.

12.      The Client's Portfolio may contain securities of which the issue or
         offer for sale is underwritten, managed or arranged by an Associate (as
         defined in the Rules of IMRO) of JOHP during the preceding twelve
         months.

13.      The Client understands that JOHP's directors or staff may from time to
         time hold shares or securities including holdings that may be in the
         Portfolio, and that JOHP's directors or staff may from time to time be
         directors of companies whose shares are held in the Portfolio.

14.      The Client acknowledges that JOHP may acquire or dispose of on the
         Client's behalf shares or units in any fund, company, trust or
         Collective Investment Scheme (as defined by the Rules of IMRO) under
         JOHP's management (or in a fund, company, trust or Collective
         Investment Scheme connected with JOHP) if JOHP considers such an
         investment to be appropriate for inclusion in or exclusion from the
         Portfolio.

CUSTODIAL SERVICES

15. (a)  Save where the Client has notified JOHP in accordance with
         paragraph 15(b), in those cases where the Client is situated in the
         United Kingdom registerable investments will be registered in the name
         of an Eligible Custodian (as defined in the Rules of IMRO) situated in
         the United Kingdom and nominated by JOHP.

    (b)  In those cases where the Client is situated overseas or where the
         Client so requests by notice in writing to JOHP, registerable
         investments will be registered in the name of an Eligible Custodian
         situated outside the United Kingdom and nominated by JOHP.

    (c)  All documents of title (including those in bearer form) will be
         retained in the custody of an Eligible Custodian nominated by JOHP and
         situated in the United Kingdom or overseas as applicable.

    (d)  None of the Eligible Custodians as aforesaid shall be Associates of
         JOHP. However, the Client's registerable investments may at any time be
         registered in the name of a nominee company which is an Associate of
         JOHP and Client's documents of title may be held by that Associate at
         any time after JOHP shall have given the Client written notice of its
         intention to do so. Such notice shall specify the nature of its
         association with such Associate.

<PAGE>
ACCOUNTS, INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS

16.      The following Client accounts, together with such others that may be
         required, will be maintained by JOHP.

         (a)  INVESTMENT ACCOUNT

              The Client's investments will be held in this account. Subject to
              paragraphs 5 and 6, JOHP shall not lend the Client's investments
              to any third party and shall not borrow money on the Client's
              behalf against the security of the Client's investments.

         (b)  CAPITAL ACCOUNT

              All uninvested cash will be held in this account by a bank chosen
              by JOHP. The account will be debited with the cost of purchases on
              the Client's behalf and with sums due and payable by the Client to
              JOHP and will be credited with the net proceeds of sales on the
              Client's behalf. Money drawn on behalf of the Client from the
              account shall not exceed the total of money held in the account on
              behalf of the Client at that time. Interest will be paid on sums
              standing to the credit of the account and held on the Client's
              behalf at the prevailing market rate. The interest will be paid
              quarterly and will be credited to the Income Account on the
              Client's behalf.

         (c)  SETTLEMENT ACCOUNT

              Money debited to the Capital Account in respect of the cost of
              purchases made on the Client's behalf and money received and
              receivable upon settlement of each sale made on the Client's
              behalf will be credited to this account and held there until the
              relevant settlement date.

         (d)  INCOME ACCOUNT

              Dividends and interest received on investments within the
              Portfolio will be credited to this account. Balances on the
              account will be paid away quarterly in accordance with the
              Client's instructions or, in the absence of such instructions,
              will be transferred quarterly to the Capital Account as soon as
              reasonably practicable after the last day of each such quarter
              being 5th April, 30th June, 5th October and 31st December in each
              year. Money drawn on behalf of the Client from the account shall
              not exceed the total of money held in the account on behalf of the
              Client at that time. Interest will not be paid on monies held in
              this account.

<PAGE>
         (d)  OFF-SHORE FUNDS

              In those cases where the Client is situated overseas or if the
              Client notifies JOHP in writing that the Client wishes cash in the
              Portfolio to be held outside the United Kingdom, JOHP will be
              (subject to applicable laws and regulations) hold such cash in a
              bank account outside the United Kingdom.

17.      The Client may at any time instruct JOHP to realize any or all of the
         investments in the Portfolio and may withdraw any sum standing to the
         credit of the Capital Account and held on the Client's behalf.

18.      JOHP shall maintain separate ledger accounts on the Client's behalf.
         All debits from and credits to the Investment Account and/or Capital
         Account and/or Income Account on the Client's behalf shall be recorded
         in the ledger accounts, and statements of account showing all
         transactions, payments and receipts up to and including 5th April of
         each year will be sent to the Client as soon as reasonably practicable
         after that date.

COMMUNICATIONS

19.      In the interests of proper administration of the Portfolio and for
         related investment purposes JOHP, its representatives or employees, may
         call upon the Client by telephone, visit or otherwise communicate
         orally with the Client without express invitation. The Client's
         attention is drawn to the fact that the Client will forfeit any right
         conferred by section 56 of the Financial Services Act 1986 to treat as
         unenforceable any investment agreement entered into in the course of or
         in consequence of such a call.

ADMINISTRATION

20.      Contract notes in respect of every purchase and sale on the Client's
         behalf will be sent to the Client before the close of business on the
         day next following the day on which the transaction was effected.

21.      JOHP will on the Client's request forward details of all transactions
         on the Client's behalf to the Client's tax advisor without additional
         charge.

22.      The Client may (upon giving reasonable notice) inspect all copy
         contract notes, vouchers and copies of entries in books or electronic
         recording media kept by JOHP or to which JOHP has access relating to
         the transactions effected by JOHP on the Client's behalf and those
         records will be maintained by JOHP or JOHP will ensure that they are
         maintained for not less than seven years from the date of the relevant
         transaction.

<PAGE>
23.      All documents will be sent to the Client at the address given above
         unless and until otherwise directed in writing. The Client agrees that
         it will immediately notify JOHP in writing of any changes of address,
         and that JOHP will not be responsible for any consequences which may
         arise from failure to do so.

REVIEWS AND VALUATIONS

24.      JOHP will prepare reviews of the Portfolio incorporating an up-to-date
         valuation of each investment comprised in the Portfolio and a statement
         of the basis on which it was valued on a six monthly basis or at such
         other frequency as may be agreed between JOHP and the Client. Such
         reviews shall be prepared as at such half yearly or other dates as
         shall be agreed between JOHP and the Client from time to time (each
         such date being referred to as a "Valuation Date"), and JOHP will send
         such reviews to the Client within twenty-five business days of each
         Valuation Date

25.      On each Valuation Date cash will be valued at its face value and each
         investment will be valued at its middle market price on the relevant
         stock exchange at the close of business on such day or (if not a
         business day) on the nearest prior business day as is supplied by
         "Exshare" or any other suitable information service chosen by JOHP
         (which figures shall be binding save for manifest error). For the
         purpose of valuing in sterling any foreign currency or any security
         listed on a foreign stock exchange the price of which is quoted in
         currency other than sterling, the valuation and middle market exchange
         rates supplied by "Exshare" or any other suitable information service
         chosen by JOHP shall be applied. In the absence of that valuation or
         exchange rate, the middle market price as determined by the Daily
         Official List of The Stock Exchange or the equivalent list for any
         relevant stock exchange will be applied. If none of the foregoing
         methods of valuation are available, the investments in question will be
         valued in such other manner (by JOHP or such other person selected by
         JOHP) as shall in JOHP's opinion be fair.

26.      JOHP accepts no liability for any period longer than 25 business days
         between any Valuation Date and the despatch of a review to the Client
         of his Portfolio which has elapsed as result of any act or omission of
         any third party.

VOTING AND OTHER RIGHTS

27.      JOHP will be entitled at its discretion and without notice to the
         Client to procure or to refrain from procuring the exercise of voting
         and other rights and privileges attaching to the investments comprised
         in the Portfolio and to accede or refrain from acceding to any
         compromise or arrangement in relation to any scheme of arrangement or
         scheme for reconstruction or amalgamation involving any such
         investment. JOHP will not forward to the Client any circulars, notices
         or proxy cards received in respect to investments comprised in the
         Portfolio.

<PAGE>

FEES, COMMISSIONS AND EXPENSES

28.      (a)  The Client will pay a management fee to JOHP in respect of the
              period beginning with first receipt by JOHP of any investments or
              money from the Client and ending with a Valuation Date (as defined
              in paragraph 24) and each period thereafter starting with the day
              after any Valuation Date and ending on the next Valuation Date (or
              the Termination Date as defined in paragraph 39 if sooner).

         (b)  The management fee shall be calculated in accordance with the
              'Scale Rates and Charges' set out in Schedule III.

         (c)  The management fee shall be payable not later than 14 days after
              despatch to the Client of an invoice which shall be sent to the
              Client as soon as is reasonably practicable after each Valuation
              Date. Unless otherwise instructed the Client's Capital Account
              will be debited with the amounts due to JOHP on the 14th day after
              despatch of such invoice.

         (d)  In addition the Client shall reimburse JOHP for any expenses or
              liabilities which it may incur in properly carrying out its duties
              hereunder.

29.      The management fee shall be deemed to have accrued on a day-to-day
         basis, so that, if this Agreement commences or terminates other than on
         a Valuation Date (as defined in paragraph 24), the amount of the fee
         shall be duly apportioned.

30.      Commissions (as set out in Schedule III) will be payable by the Client
         on purchases and sales of investments together will all expenses
         including stamp duties, stamp duty reserve tax and VAT thereon (if
         applicable). The Client recognizes that JOHP may gain a commission
         benefit from dealing in a bulk purchase or sale on behalf of JOHP's
         clients, one of whom may be the Client, or from return commissions
         which benefit JOHP shall be entitled to retain. JOHP will be free to
         accept and retain as an addition to its fees and commissions any other
         commissions which it receives in the course of its dealing on the
         Client's behalf: all such benefits and receipts shall supplement any
         other remuneration receivable by JOHP in connection with transactions
         effected by JOHP with or for the Client under this or any other
         agreement with the Client and the Client consents to all such benefits
         and receipts as are referred to above without prior disclosure of the
         same to the Client on a case-by-case basis provided that JOHP
         undertakes to secure for the Client best execution of all transactions
         effected with or through a party from whom JOHP receives such benefits
         and commissions, disregarding any benefit which the Client might obtain
         directly or indirectly as a result of such arrangements.

<PAGE>
31.      JOHP shall be entitled to alter the manner of computing or charging its
         fees, commissions and expenses or of paying interest on the money held
         on the Client's behalf in the Capital Account (including with prejudice
         to the generality of the foregoing its scale rates and charges) by
         giving one month's prior notice in writing to the Client.

RESPONSIBILITY AND INSURANCE

32.      JOHP will indemnify the Client in respect of any loss incurred as a
         result of negligence, wilful default or fraud by JOHP or any of its
         employees. Subject to the above, JOHP will not be responsible or liable
         for any claim, loss, damage, expense or costs arising by reason of any
         of the following:

         (a)  any investment decision taken and acted upon in accordance with
              the terms of this Agreement; or

         (b)  any delay or default in the performance of its obligations under
              this Agreement arising in consequence of any event or circumstance
              beyond the reasonable control of JOHP; or

         (c)  any act or omission on the part of any of the banks or nominee
              companies controlled by them or other eligible custodians as
              referred to in paragraph 15 or any other person to which any of
              them shall have delegated its function or on the part of any other
              third party whatsoever; or

         (d)  any consequential loss suffered in consequence of any act or
              omission of JOHP or any breach of JOHP of any term of this
              Agreement.

33.      The Client agrees to indemnify and keep indemnified JOHP from and
         against all demands, claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and
         expenses whatsoever incurred by JOHP arising out of the breach by the
         Client of any warranty or by reason of any failure by the Client to
         comply with and/or perform any of the terms and conditions in this
         Agreement.

34.      Where the Client is a joint account (whether or not a trust account)
         JOHP shall unless and until otherwise directed in writing by all the
         persons named in the joint account, be entitled to act on the
         instructions of any of them and shall not in any whatsoever be liable
         to the others for doing so.

35.      JOHP has effected insurance to provide for the protection of the Client
         against losses arising from any negligence of JOHP or any dishonesty of
         employees of JOHP.

<PAGE>
36.      Under Section 54 of the Financial Services Act 1986 The Securities and
         Investments Board has established a scheme for compensating investors
         by which the Client may be entitled to compensation in the event of
         JOHP's inability to meet any liabilities to the Client. JOHP will make
         available to the Client upon request a statement describing the
         Client's rights to compensation under the scheme.

DELEGATION AND USE OF AGENTS

37.      JOHP my delegate any of its functions under this Agreement to an
         Associate and may provide information about the Client and the
         Portfolio to any such Associate but JOHP's liability to the Client for
         all matters so delegated shall not be affected thereby. JOHP shall give
         to the Client written notice of any delegation of a function which
         involves the exercise of its discretionary investment management
         powers.

38.      JOHP may employ agents (including Associates) to perform any
         administrative, dealing, custodial and ancillary services required to
         enable JOHP to perform its services under this Agreement. JOHP
         undertakes to act in good faith and with due diligence in the choice
         and use of such agents.

TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT

39.      This Agreement may be terminated by either party by giving written
         notice of termination to the other at any time. Termination shall take
         effect on the day upon which the other party actually receives the
         notice (the "Termination Date") provided that, where the Client is a
         joint account, notice of termination by JOHP shall be given to every
         person named in the joint account and in such circumstances the
         Termination Date shall be deemed to be the day after the date of
         posting by first class recorded delivery or other appropriate means to
         all persons named in the joint account.

40.      Upon the Termination Date, JOHP will complete expeditiously all
         transactions in progress at termination but will not execute any
         further transactions for the Client. Upon all fees, commissions,
         expenses and other sums due to it and any other liabilities for which
         it may be or become liable in connection with the management of the
         Portfolio being settled or adequately secured to the satisfaction of
         JOHP, JOHP will ensure that all investments and cash balances held on
         the Client's behalf will, after any outstanding security registration,
         stock exchange settlements and other administrative matters have been
         completed and as soon as reasonably practicable, be transferred to the
         Client or dealt with in accordance with the Client's instructions, in
         all cases at the cost of the Client.

41.      Termination will not affect accrued rights, existing commitments or any
         contractual provision intended to survive termination and will be
         without penalty or other additional payment except that JOHP may charge
         the Client an amount equal to:

<PAGE>

         (a)  the relevant proportion of the management fee, corresponding to
              that part of the period ending on a Valuation Date by reference to
              which fees are payable, which has expired when this Agreement is
              terminated;

         (b)  any additional expenses which JOHP necessarily incurs in
              terminating this Agreement; and

         (c)  any losses necessarily realized in settling or concluding
              outstanding obligations.

42.      The death, bankruptcy or other incapacity or, in the case of a body
         corporate, the cessation of business of the Client or a petition being
         presented or a meeting being convened to consider a resolution for the
         liquidation of the Client shall not of itself terminate JOHP's
         appointment; but JOHP may at its discretion treat its receipt of actual
         notice of any such events as if it were a written notice of termination
         from the Client.

43.      If the Client is a joint account the Client's obligations under this
         Agreement shall be joint and several. On the death of any of the
         persons constituting the Client (being survived by any such other
         person), the Agreement shall not terminate and, except in the case of
         trustees, the interest of the deceased in the Portfolio shall
         automatically enure to the benefit of the survivor(s) unless otherwise
         specified by notice in writing to JOHP.

CLIENT WARRANTIES

44.      The Client warrants that the Client is the beneficial owner (or the
         duly authorized agent of the beneficial owner) of the whole of the
         Portfolio free from all liens, charges, encumbrances and restrictions
         on transfer except insofar as advised by the Client to JOHP, and will
         so remain during the currency of this Agreement.

45.      The Client warrants that the Client is empowered to enter into this
         Agreement without the consent or authority of any other party and in
         the case of a Client being a body corporate the Client warrants that by
         entering into this Agreement it is not nor will it be in breach of its
         Memorandum or Articles of Association or any other relevant document.

GENERAL

46.      Terms and expressions defined in the rules of IMRO for the time being
         in force shall where the context so admits bear the same meaning in
         this Agreement.

47.      The Clause headings in this Agreement are included for ease of
         reference only and shall not affect its interpretation.

<PAGE>
48.      The Schedules to this Agreement are an integral part of it.

49.      If the Client is an individual this Agreement shall be binding on his
         legal personal representatives.

50.      This Agreement is personal to the parties hereto and shall not be
         capable of assignment.

51.      Subject to clause 31, no change, alteration or modification to this
         Agreement or the Schedules hereto shall be made unless in writing and
         signed by the parties hereto.

52.      Notice required or authorised to be served hereunder must be addressed
         to the address of the recipient stated above or to such other address
         as may have been notified in writing by either party hereto to the
         other as its address for the service of notices. In the case of notice
         served by the client from outside the United Kingdom and of notice
         served upon the Client at an address outside the United Kingdom, the
         notice shall be sufficiently served if served by pre-paid letter, cable
         or telex. In the case of notice served by the Client from within the
         United Kingdom and of notice served upon the Client at an address
         within the United Kingdom the notice shall be sufficiently served if
         served by pre-paid letter.

53.      If the client makes a complaint to JOHP verbally or in writing about
         any service JOHP has rendered to the Client under this Agreement the
         complaint shall immediately be referred to JOHP's Chief Executive or to
         a Senior Investment Manager who was not involved in the circumstances
         relating to the complaint and who will investigate such circumstances.

         to the Client and take any action he deems necessary to rectify the
         matter which is the subject of the complaint. The Client has the right

                                   SCHEDULE I

                                  THE PORTFOLIO

                     Valuation and composition of Portfolio
           (see attached letter/opening valuation - where applicable)

                                   SCHEDULE II

                 INVESTMENT POLICY, GUIDELINES AND RESTRICTIONS

                   PART I - Investment Policy including basis
                          of measurement of performance

The investment objectives are to maintain a maximum total return commensurate
with safety and the protection of the underlying value of the capital of the
fund.


The performance will be measured against the F.T. All Share Index, any other
appropriate Index or measure of performance agreed upon by JOHP
and the Client.

                      PART II - Guidelines and Restrictions

1.       There will be no restrictions placed on the types of investment in
         which the money comprised in the Portfolio will be invested provided
         that the services to be provided by JOHP will not include advising on
         or effecting Contingent Liability Transactions, nor will they, without
         the express prior authority of the Client, relate to options, futures
         or contracts for differences (or to any right or interest in such
         investments).

2.       The contents of the Portfolio may be invested in any market save for
         the following.

         There shall be no restriction on the amount of monies or proportion of
         the Portfolio invested in any one investment or type of investment
         permitted hereunder provided that, subject to the provisions relating
         to overdraft contained in paragraph 6 of this Agreement, under no
         circumstances will JOHP make investment on behalf of the Client to a
         value in excess of the aggregate of the value of the funds and
         securities held by JOHP on behalf of the Client in the accounts
         referred to in paragraph 16 of this Agreement.

             PART III - Risk Warnings and Risk Disclosure Statement

                  Investments denominated in foreign Currencies

<PAGE>
If a liability of the Client in one currency is to be matched by an asset in a
different currency, or if JOHP provides services under this Agreement relating
to any investment denominated in a foreign currency, a movement in exchange
rates may have an effect which may be either favorable or unfavorable on the
investment, which effect may be separate from the gain or loss otherwise
experienced on such investment.

                       Investments not readily realisable

Certain categories of investments comprised in the Portfolio may not be readily
realisable. You should be aware that there can be no certainty that market
makers or brokers will be prepared to deal in such investments and that proper
information for determining their current value may not be available.

                                    Warrants

A warrant is a right to subscribe for shares, debentures, loan stock or
government securities, and is exercisable against the original issuer of the
securities. Warrants often involve a high degree of gearing so that a relatively
small movement in the price of the underlying security results in a
disproportionately large movement, unfavorable as well as favorable, in the
price of the warrant. The prices of warrants can therefore be volatile.

                                  Stabilisation

This statement is made in compliance with Rule 14 of Chapter IV of the rules of
IMRO.

"We or our representatives may from time to time effect on your behalf or
recommend to you transactions in securities which are the subject of a recent
new issue where the price of those transactions may have been influenced by bids
made or transactions effected for the purpose of stabilising the price of those
securities. You should read the explanation below carefully. Its purpose is to
enable you to judge whether you wish your funds to be invested at all in such
securities or, if so, whether you wish to authorize us generally to effect
transaction in such securities on your behalf without further reference to you
or hether you wish to be consulted before any particular transaction in effected
on your behalf.

Stabilisation is a process whereby the market price of a security is pegged or
fixed during the period in which a new issue of securities is sold to the
public. Stabilisation may take place in the new issue or in other securities
related to the new issue in such a way that the price of the other securities
may affect the price of the new issue or vice versa.

The reason stabilisation is permitted is that when a new issue is brought to
market the sudden glut will sometimes force the price lower for a period of time
before buyers are found for the securities on offer.

<PAGE>

As long as he obeys a strict set of rules the "stabilising manager", normal the
issuing house chiefly responsible for bringing a new issue to market, is
entitled to buy securities in the market that he has previously sold to
investors or allotted to institutions who were included in the new issue but who
have decided not to continue participating. The effect of this may be to keep
the price at a higher level than would otherwise be the case during the period
of stabilising.

The rules limit the period in which he may stabilise, fix the price at which he
may stabilize (in the case of shares and warrants but not bonds), and require
him to disclose that he may be (but not that he is) stabilising.

The fact that a new issue or a related security is being stabilised does not in
itself mean that investors are not interested in the issue, but neither should
the existence of transactions in an issue where stabilising may take place be
relied upon as an indication that investors are interest in the new issue or
interested in purchasing at the price at which transactions are taking place".

                                                            16th February, 1995



Dear Sirs,

Appointment as Investment Adviser

You, the directors of Consulta (Channel Islands) Limited (the "Manager") wish to
appoint us, J O Hambro & Partners Limited, as your investment adviser for Oryx
International Growth Fund Limited (the "Fund") and we are willing to act as an
investment adviser to the Fund and you on the terms set out below.

Terms used and defined in the placing memorandum dated 16th February 1995 (the
"Placing Memorandum") will have the same meanings in this letter.

You will have overall responsibility for the investment of the Fund subject to
the overall investment policy agreed by the directors of the Fund and any
instructions given by them from time to time. Our role will be to provide the
Fund and you with specialist investment advice, research and assistance
principally on the United Kingdom and European markets (though not excluding
limited investments in other parts of the world) and medium and small companies
trading on those markets (in particular, those which are under-valued and have
strong growth potential) and to make investment recommendations and to give
general advice whenever called upon so to do in relation to the development and
regulation of the investment policy of the Fund.

In addition, we will be expected to:

      (i)   advise the Fund and you concerning the action which it appears to us
            that the Fund should take in order to carry into effect its
            investment policy and objectives;

      (ii)  keep under surveillance and review and generally analyze the
            performance of the Fund's investments;

<PAGE>

      (iii) give all such assistance to the Administrator as the Administrator
            may reasonably require for the purpose of making valuations of the
            Fund's investments in accordance with the Articles of Association of
            the Fund and Placing Memorandum as you and the Fund may from time to
            time reasonable require; and

      (iv)  prepare such material on the economy, industry, securities markets
            and medium and smaller companies of the United Kingdom, Europe and,
            in limited circumstances, other areas of the world as the directors
            of the Fund may request whenever they reasonably require such
            material.

Our services hereunder are not to be deemed exclusive and we shall be free to
render similar services to others so long as our services hereunder are not
impaired thereby. However, in providing such services we will at all times
comply with the terms of the Placing Memorandum, in particular the sections
headed "Conflicts of Interest" on page 13 and the descriptions of our
appointment and this agreement.

In consideration for the services to be provided by us hereunder, we are to
receive an annual fee from you at the rate of 1.25 per cent. on the first
(pound)15,000,000 and 1 per cent. of any excess, in each case of the Net Asset
Value of the Fund (as defined in the Articles of Association of the Fund). Such
fee shall accrue daily, shall be calculated by reference to the Net Asset Value
of the Fund on the last Business Day of each month and shall be paid monthly in
arrears to such bank account as we notify you for the purpose. We will also be
reimbursed for our reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in attending
meetings of the directors of the Fund where required by the directors and in
traveling in connection with our role as investment adviser and the provision of
services hereunder, but all our other expenses will be borne by us.

Our appointment shall become effective upon the allotment of the Shares and the
delivery of the Warrants and Convertible Stock of the Fund pursuant to the
proposed placing of the Units in the Fund by S.G. Warburg Securities Ltd and
shall be for an initial term of two years. The appointment shall continue and
remain in full force and effect thereafter unless and until terminated by either
of us giving the other not less than twelve months' written notice of
termination or on the insolvency of either of us or in the event of a material
breach of the provisions hereof which breach continues for 30 days after receipt
of notice to remedy it.

However, you will have the right to give four months' notice of termination of
our appointment (a) if Christopher Mills dies or leaves our employment of (b)
if, for whatever reason, either Christopher Mills does not provide investment
advice to the Fund or we do not provide the services outlined in this
appointment letter for a period of more than 21 days without your prior written
consent.

We will, however, have the opportunity to suggest an alternative investment
adviser if Christopher Mills dies or leaves our employment and you will put the
alternative to the directors of the Fund for their consideration within seven
days of the receipt by you of the name we suggest provided that the alternative
suggestion is made within three months of you giving us notice of termination of
our appointment.

Any notice required to be given hereunder may be served by being left at or sent
by recorded delivery to the registered office for the time being of the party on
which it is served and any notice given by post shall be deemed to be have been
served at the expiration of 72 hours after it is posted, and in proving such
service it will be sufficient to prove that the envelope containing the notice
was properly addressed and sent by recorded delivery.

<PAGE>

We acknowledge that we will not have any authority to enter into a transaction
for the purchase or sale of any investment by the Fund without the prior consent
of the directors of the Fund or a duly authorized committee thereof if the
consideration is in excess of (pound)100,000 or, (in the case of a purchase),
the investment is intended to be held for more than five years. Such consent
shall not, however, be required where the investment concerned involves either
an increase or decrease in the level of an investment in the securities of any
particular issuer already held in the Fund's portfolio.

This letter shall be governed and construed in accordance with English law.

Please confirm our appointment as Investment Adviser on the above terms by
signing and returning the enclosed copy of this letter.

Yours faithfully,

/s/ R.C.O. Hellyer

      charged to capital and/or revenue in such proportions as the Board shall
      from time to time consider to be appropriate after consultation with the
      Manager and the Auditors. Such fee shall accrue daily, be calculated on
      the last business day of each calendar month based on the Net Asset Value
      at that date and be payable in arrears within 14 days after the end of
      each calendar month.

<PAGE>

7.2   The fee payable in respect of the period from the Effective Date to the
      end of the current calendar month (the "First Month") shall be calculated
      by dividing the figure specified in Clause 7.1 by the total number of days
      in the First Month and multiplying it by the number of days which elapse
      between the Effective Date and the end of the First Month inclusive.

7.3   If this Agreement is terminated otherwise than at the end of any calendar
      month for the purpose of calculating the fee payable in respect of the
      period from the beginning of the then current calendar month (the "Partial
      Month") to the date of termination the figure specified in Clause 7.1
      shall be divided by the total number of days in the Partial Month and
      shall be multiplied by the number of days which elapse between the
      beginning of the Partial Month and the date of termination.

            other loan capital in the Fund and holding, disposing of or
            otherwise dealing with the same with the same rights which it would
            have held if the Manager were not a party to this Agreement;

      (b)   buying, holding and dealing upon its own account in Investments
            which are the same or similar to Investments held by or for the
            account of the Fund PROVIDED THAT neither the Manager nor any
            Associated Person of the Manager shall deal with the Fund as a
            beneficial owner on the sale or purchase of investments to or from
            the Fund except on a basis approved by the Directors from time to
            time, or without the consent of the Directors otherwise deal with
            the Fund as principal;

      (c)   dealing with the Fund as agent PROVIDED THAT any such dealings are

            third party and the Manager or any Associated Person of the Manager
            may (in such circumstances) charge and retain a commission or fee in
            respect of any such dealings;

      result of the Manager acting outside the scope of the authority granted to
      it by the Fund hereunder or in breach of any limitations thereon from to
      time imposed by the Board) or otherwise arising out of the performance or
      non-performance of its duties, obligations, rights and authorities
      hereunder, PROVIDED THAT the Manager shall not be liable to the Fund for
      any decline in the value of the assets of the Fund or any part thereof to
      the extent that such decline results from the Manager's implementation of
      any express direction of the Board or from any investment decision made by
      the Manager in good faith unless such decision was reckless, negligent or
      otherwise in wilful breach of any duty owed by the Manager to the Fund.

12.3  The Manager shall be entitled to obtain legal advice from its lawyers for
      the time being if it reasonably considers that such advice is necessary or

      and, if the Fund shall give its express written approval to the obtaining
      of any such advice or opinion, the Fund shall pay or procure payment of
      the reasonable expenses thereof. Any reasonable action or omission taken

      with such advice or opinion shall be full protection and justification to
      it with respect to the action or omission so taken or suffered.

12.4  The Fund hereby undertakes to hold harmless and indemnify the Manager or
      procure the Manager to be held harmless and indemnified against all

      by reason of the proper performance of its duties in accordance with the
      terms of this Agreement in each case including all reasonable legal,
      professional and other expenses properly incurred in connection therewith
      (including any such actions, proceedings and claims as shall arise as a
      result of loss, delay, misdelivery or error in transmission of any cable,
      telex, telefax, telegraphic or other communication), except such as shall
      arise from its bad faith, wilful breach of duty under this Agreement or
      reckless or negligent act or omission on its part.

12.5  Without prejudice to the generality of the preceding provisions of this
      Clause, the Manager will not be responsible for any loss suffered by the
      Fund as a result of any default by:

<PAGE>

      (a)   the Custodian or the Administrator; or

      (b)   any bank or other financial institution holding money pursuant to
            Clause 5 of this Agreement; or

      (c)   any counterparty or other person with whom the Manager arranges or
            enters any transaction for the Fund pursuant to this Agreement (but
            the Manager shall use all reasonable endeavours at the expense and
            written request of the Fund diligently to pursue remedies against
            any such cournterparty),

unless such default is the direct result of the Manager's wilful default or
negligence.

12.6  The Manager shall not be required to take any legal action in connection
      with the performance of its duties under this Agreement or on half of the
      Fund unless fully indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction for losses
      costs and liabilities which may be incurred or suffered by it. The Fund
      shall be entitled to require the Manager, in taking any action of
      whatsoever nature hereunder, to act in accordance with any reasonable
      direction of the Fund (including directions as to compromise or
      settlement) in connection with any claim against the Manager for which the
      Fund may ultimately be liable, but if, in the reasonable opinion of the
      Manager, acting in accordance with such directions might make the Manager
      liable for the payment of money or liable in any other way, the Manager
      shall be and be kept indemnified in any reasonable amount and form
      satisfactory to the Manager as a prerequisite to taking such action.

13.   VOTING RIGHTS OF INVESTMENTS

13.1  All rights of voting conferred by Investments held under this Agreement
      shall be exercised or not in such manner as the Manager may reasonably
      determine PROVIDED THAT if the Fund shall instruct the Manager as to the
      exercise of voting rights in respect of such Investments the Manager shall
      give effect to such instructions.

13.2  If the Manager shall have been expressly notified in writing by the Board
      of any interest of any member of the Board in any Investment, the Manager
      shall seek the instructions of the Board prior to the exercise any rights
      of voting thereon and the Fund undertakes to procure that each member of
      the Board forthwith notifies the Manager of any change in any interest
      notified to the Manager pursuant to this subclause.

      execute and deliver or cause to be executed and delivered to the Manager

      otherwise act in accordance with this Agreement in respect of all or any
      part of the Investments of the Fund.

(1)   Unless it receives contrary instructions from the Company, the Manager
      shall make arrangements for the safekeeping of all cash, securities or

      Company until the cash or assets concerned have been made available to the
      Manager following execution of this Agreement. Insofar as the Manager

      such assets), it shall do so separately from its own assets and on trust
      for the Company.

(2)   The Manager shall arrange for (i) any uninvested cash to be held in the
      Company's name in one or more accounts with Bank of Scotland or other

      (b) the exchange of securities where the exchange is purely ministerial
          (including the exchange of temporary securities for those in
          definitive form and the exchange of warrants for, or other documents
          of entitlement to securities for, the securities themselves);

      (c) the surrender of securities at maturity or when called for redemption
          against payment therefor.

(4)   The Manager shall notify any bank or custodian holding property comprised
      in the Portfolio that it is not the Manager's property.

(5)   The Manager shall have no right of lien or set-off or any right of
      retention with respect to any Investments held in the Portfolio.

      securities held in the Portfolio are to be forwarded to the Company or are
      to be dealt with in accordance with instructions given by the Company from
      time to time.

      value added tax) by reference to the Net Asset Value (calculated on a
      gross assets basis) as at 30th September, the first such payment, being a
      pro rata part of the annual fee, to be made on 31st December 1993 in
      respect of the period from the date of this Agreement to 30th September,
      1993. On termination of this Agreement a pro rata fee shall be payable for
      any part of the year to 30th September for which this Agreement is in
      force, payable on the 31st December next following termination.

(2)   The Company shall bear the expenses of any kind incurred by or on behalf
      of the Manager in the carrying out of its duties and the provision of
      services and facilities hereunder, save for telex, telephone and other
      routine communication charges and the costs of providing normal office
      accommodation and secretarial and clerical staff for the normal
      performance of those duties.

(3)   The Manager shall also be entitled to additional fees, calculated on a
      time basis, for services provided in connection with any transactions
      involving the Company and/or any of its subsidiaries outside the ordinary
      course of business including in particular any issue of shares, debentures

      respect thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Manager shall be
      entitled, without delivery of an invoice as aforesaid, to charge any such
      amount to the Portfolio subject to notifying the Company in writing of the
      amount promptly thereafter.

(5)   For the purpose of this Clause 8 "Net Asset Value" shall mean the amount

      indebtedness in the nature of borrowings (except for borrowings repayable
      after an initial term of more than three years) of the Company and its
      subsidiaries as reasonably determined by the Manager.

9.    Subsidiaries

      If the Company has at any time one or more subsidiaries then, unless

      Company.

10.   Freedom to act

      The services of the Manager to the Company under this Agreement shall not
      be exclusive and the Manager shall be free to render similar services to
      others and nothing in this Agreement shall preclude the Manager from
      having dealings with or on behalf of the Company either on its own account
      or on account of its clients or others or make it accountable to the
      Company in respect of any profit or commission from any such dealings.

<PAGE>

      (b) either party shall have a receiver or administrator appointed over the
          whole or any part of their assets or a resolution is passed or an

      termination (except where such appointment is terminated by the Manager in
      accordance with sub-clause (1)(a) of this Clause or by the Company in
      breach of Clause 2) and the Manager shall deliver to the Company or as it
      shall direct, all books of account, records, registers, correspondence,
      documents and assets belonging to the Company or any subsidiary in
      possession of or under the control of the Manager and take all necessary
      steps to vest in the Company any assets previously held in the name of or
      to the order of the Manager on behalf of the Company or any subsidiary.

(3)   The Manager shall also be entitled to terminate its appointment on giving
      four months' notice to the Company if either the Board fails to procure
