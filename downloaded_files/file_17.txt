     (f)  Each of TBC and TBK is a Delaware limited partnership. Each of the
General Partners and Thomas P. Knapp is a citizen of the United States of

ITEM 3. SOURCE AND AMOUNTS OF FUNDS OR OTHER CONSIDERATION


     As of the date hereof, the number of shares with respect to which TBC may
be deemed to be the beneficial owner is 165,100 shares of Common Stock (the "TBC
Shares"), all of which shares were purchased in open market transactions. The
aggregate cost of the TBC Shares, including brokerage commissions, was $881,696.

     The TBC Shares are held in the TBC Accounts, the funds therefor coming from
the funds on hand in each individual managed account and in certain instances
from standard margin account borrowings from brokerage accounts maintained at
Fleet Clearing Corporation. It is expected that funds used by the TBC Accounts
to purchase additional shares of Common Stock, if additional shares are
purchased by the TBC Accounts (see Item 4 hereof), will come from the funds on
hand for each individual managed account, which funds on hand at any time and
from time to time may include, among others, funds borrowed pursuant to margin
accounts maintained at Fleet Clearing Corporation. Borrowings made by certain
TBC Accounts pursuant to such margin accounts are secured by margin securities
owned by the respective accounts, including some of the TBC Shares. Interest on
outstanding borrowings under such margin accounts ranges from 1/2% to 2% over
the brokers' call rate in effect from time to time at Chase Manhattan Bank, New
York, New York, depending upon the amount of outstanding borrowings at any given
time.

     As of the date hereof, TBK beneficially owns directly 11,000 shares of
Common Stock (the "TBK Shares"), all of which shares were purchased in open
market transactions. The aggregate cost of the TBK Shares, including brokerage
commissions, was $59,060.

     It is expected that funds used by TBK to purchase additional shares of
Common Stock, if additional shares are purchased by TBK (see Item 4 hereof),
will come from TBK's general funds, which include cash and cash equivalents on
hand and in banks.


<PAGE>   7

     TBK's general funds have included, and it is expected that they will from
time to time include, funds borrowed by it pursuant to an understanding with
Chase Manhattan Bank. As of the date hereof, TBK has a loan outstanding with
Chase Manhattan Bank in the amount of $20,000. Borrowings made by TBK pursuant
to that understanding bear interest at the brokers' call rate in effect from
time to time at Chase Manhattan Bank. TBK's funds may also include funds
borrowed pursuant to a Line of Credit Agreement between TBK and Boston Safe
Deposit and Trust Company. Pursuant to the Line of Credit Agreement, TBK may
borrow up to $15,000,000 at the brokers' call rate charged from time to time by
Boston Safe Deposit & Trust Company. Borrowings made by TBK pursuant to its
understandings with Chase Manhattan Bank and the Line of Credit Agreement with
Boston Safe Deposit and Trust Company are secured by securities owned by TBK;
such borrowings are not secured by any TBK Shares. No borrowings from Chase
Manhattan Bank or Boston Safe Deposit and Trust Company were made for the
purpose of acquiring the TBK Shares. TBK reserves the right to include all or
any of the shares of Common Stock owned by it at any time or from time to time,
among the securities that serve as collateral for such borrowings, subject to
compliance with any applicable statutes and regulations.


ITEM 4.  PURPOSE OF TRANSACTION

     Each of TBC and TBK has acquired the shares of Common Stock owned by it for
investment purposes and for none of the reasons enumerated in Item 4 of Schedule
13D, except that TBC and TBK may dispose of all or some of the TBC Shares and
the TBK Shares , respectively, or may acquire additional shares of Common Stock
from time to time, depending upon price and market conditions, evaluation of
alternative investments, and other factors. Currently, TBC and TBK intend to
acquire additional shares of Common Stock in the open market, depending upon the
price of the Common Stock from time to time.


ITEM 5.  INTEREST IN SECURITIES OF THE ISSUER

     (a)  As of the date hereof, TBC may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of
an aggregate of 165,100 shares of Common Stock, which constitutes approximately
5.32% of the 3,102,328 shares of Common Stock which TBC believes to be the total
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. The TBC Shares are held in the TBC
Accounts.

     As of the date hereof, TBK beneficially owns directly 11,000 shares of
Common Stock, which constitutes approximately 0.35% of the 3,102,328 shares of
Common Stock which TBK believes to be the total number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding.

     Each of TBC and TBK disclaims that it is the beneficial owner of any of the
shares of Common Stock held in the TBC Accounts. The aggregate number of shares
of Common Stock with respect to which TBC and TBK could be deemed to be the
beneficial owner as of the date hereof, is 176,150 shares, which constitutes
approximately 5.67% of the 3,102,328 shares of Common Stock, which the filing
persons believe to be the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding,
but nothing contained herein shall be construed as an admission that TBC is the
beneficial owner of any of the TBC Shares.

     The aggregate number of shares and percentage of Common Stock with respect
to which each of the General Partners may be deemed to be the beneficial owner
by reason of his being a general partner of TBC, and TBK, respectively, is
176,150 shares, which constitutes approximately 5.67% of the 3,102,328 shares of
Common Stock outstanding. The aggregate number of shares and percentage of
Common Stock with respect to which Thomas P. Knapp may be deemed to be a
beneficial owner by reason of his being a general partner of TBK is 11,000
shares of Common Stock which constitutes approximately 0.35% of the 3,102,328
shares of Common Stock outstanding. However, nothing contained herein shall be
construed as an admission that any of the General Partners or Thomas P. Knapp is
the beneficial owner of any shares of Common Stock, except as set forth herein
as expressly and admittedly being beneficially owned by a particular General
Partner or Thomas P. Knapp.


<PAGE>   8

     Each of TBC and TBK disclaims beneficial ownership of Common Stock held by
the other. Except as described herein, to the best knowledge of TBC and TBK, no
person who may be deemed to comprise a group with any of TBC and TBK, or any
other person named in Item 2 hereof, beneficially owns any shares of Common
Stock.

     (b)  TBC has investment discretion with respect to 165,100 shares of Common
Stock held by the TBC Accounts and has sole power to dispose or direct the
disposition of all of such shares. Of these shares of Common Stock, TBC has sole
power to vote or to direct the voting of 123,150 shares of Common Stock held in
certain TBC Accounts.

     Each of the General Partners of TBC, solely by reason of their positions as
such, may be deemed to have (i) shared power to dispose of or to direct the
disposition of all of the shares of Common Stock held in the TBC Accounts; and
(ii) shared power to vote or direct the vote of 123,150 shares of Common Stock
held in certain TBC Accounts.

     TBK has the sole power to vote or direct the voting of and dispose or
direct the disposition of the TBK Shares. Each of the General Partners and
Thomas P. Knapp, solely by reason of their positions as general partners, may be
deemed to have shared power to vote or direct the vote of and to dispose or
direct the disposition of the TBK Shares.

     (c)  During the sixty-day period ended as of the date hereof, no
transactions in Common Stock were effected by TBK. During the sixty-day period
ended as of the date hereof, transactions in Common Stock effected by TBC are as
follows:

     WHEREAS, TBC and TBK may be deemed to have acquired, in the aggregate,
beneficial ownership of more than five percent of the Common Stock (the "Common

     WHEREAS, pursuant to Rule 13d-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(the "Act"), a Statement on Schedule 13D must be filed by any person who
acquires more than five percent of registered equity securities; and

     WHEREAS, in accordance with Rule 13d-1(f) of the Act, only one such
Statement need be filed whenever two or more persons are required to file such a

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual agreements

Act, to file one Statement on Schedule 13D relating to their ownership of the
Common Stock, and do hereby further agree that said Statement shall be filed on
behalf of each of TBC and TBK. Nothing herein, however, shall be, or shall be
