Item 1.   Security and Issuer
          The class of equity securities to which this statement on
Schedule 13D relates is the Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share
("Securities"), of Fibreboard Corporation (the "Issuer"), a
Delaware corporation, with principal offices located at 2200 Ross
Avenue, Suite 3600, Dallas, Texas 75201.

Item 2.   Identity and Background
          This statement is being filed by Mario J. Gabelli ("Mr.
Gabelli") and various entities which he directly or indirectly
controls or for which he acts as chief investment officer.  These
entities, except for Lynch Corporation ("Lynch"), Spinnaker
Industries, Incorporated ("Spinnaker"), Western New Mexico
Telephone Company ("Western New Mexico"), Entoleter, Inc. ("Entole-
ter"),  Lynch Telecommunications Corporation ("Lynch Telecom"),
Lynch Telephone Corporation ("Lynch Telephone") and Inter-Community
Telephone Company ("Inter-Community") (collectively, "Lynch and its
affiliates"), engage in various aspects of the securities business,
primarily as investment adviser to various institutional and
individual clients, including registered investment companies and
pension plans, as broker/dealer and as general partner of various
private investment partnerships.  Certain of these entities may
also make investments for their own accounts. 
          The foregoing persons in the aggregate often own
beneficially more than 5% of a class of equity securities of a
particular issuer.  Although several of the foregoing persons are
treated as institutional investors for purposes of reporting their
beneficial ownership on the short-form Schedule 13G, the holdings
of those who do not qualify as institutional investors may exceed
the 1% threshold presented for filing on Schedule 13D or implemen-
tation of their investment philosophy may from time to time require
action which could be viewed as not completely passive.  In order
to avoid any question as to whether their beneficial ownership is
being reported on the proper form and in order to provide greater
investment flexibility and administrative uniformity, these persons
have decided to file their beneficial ownership reports on the more
detailed Schedule 13D form rather than on the short-form Schedule
13G and thereby to provide more expansive disclosure than may be
necessary. 
          (a), (b) and (c) - This statement is being filed by one
or more of the following persons: Gabelli Funds, Inc. ("GFI"),
GAMCO Investors, Inc. ("GAMCO"), Gabelli Securities, Inc. ("GSI"),

Partnership L.P. ("GPP"), GLI, Inc. ("GLI"), Gabelli Associates
Fund ("Gabelli Associates"), Gabelli Associates Limited ("GAL"),
Gabelli & Company, Inc. Profit Sharing Plan (the "Plan"), Gabelli
International Limited ("GIL"), Gabelli International II Limited
("GIL II"), Gabelli International Gold Fund Limited ("GIGFL"), ALCE
Partners, L.P. ("ALCE"), Gabelli Multimedia Partners, L.P.
("Multimedia Partners"), Gabelli Asset Management Company Interna-
tional Advisory Services Ltd. ("GIASL"),Gabelli Foundation, Inc.

          (d) and (e) -  On December 8, 1994, the SEC instituted 
and simultaneously accepted offers for the settlement of an
administrative proceeding against Gabelli & Company and GAMCO.  The
order instituting the proceeding included a finding, which Gabelli

to implement and maintain policies and procedures reasonably
designed to prevent the misuse of material, nonpublic information
by not sepecifically addressing the special circumstances that
arose from their affiliation with Lynch Corporation, a public
company.  To resolve this matter, Gabelli & Company and GAMCO
agreed to cease and desist from violating Section 15(f) of the 1934
Act and Section 204A of the Advisers Act, respectively.  They
further agreed to each pay a civil penalty in the amount of
$50,000, and to retain, and adopt the recommendations of, an
independant consultant regarding their Section 15(f) and Section
204A policies and procedures.  
     (f) - Reference is made to Schedule I hereto.

its affiliates, are engaged in the business of securities analysis
and investment and pursue an investment philosophy of identifying
undervalued situations.  In pursuing this investment philosophy,

markets of companies in which they invest, including the Issuer, on
a continuous basis through analysis of documentation and discus-
sions with knowledgeable industry and market observers and with
representatives of such companies (often at the invitation of
management). The Reporting Persons do not believe they possess
material inside information concerning the Issuer.  As a result of
these analytical activities one or more of the Reporting Persons
may issue analysts reports, participate in interviews or hold
discussions with third parties or with management in which the
Reporting Person may suggest or take a position with respect to
potential changes in the operations, management or capital
structure of such companies as a means of enhancing shareholder
values. Such suggestions or positions may relate to one or more of
the transactions specified in clauses (a) through (j) of Item 4 of
the Schedule 13D form, including, without limitation, such matters
as disposing of one or more businesses, selling the company or
acquiring another company or business, changing operating or
marketing strategies, adopting or not adopting, certain types of
anti-takeover measures and restructuring the company's capitaliza-
tion or dividend policy. 
          Each of the Reporting Persons intends to adhere to the
foregoing investment philosophy with respect to the Issuer.  How-
ever, none of the Reporting Persons intends to seek control of the
Issuer or participate in the management of the Issuer, and any
Reporting Person that is registered as an investment company under
the l940 Act will participate in such a transaction only following
receipt of an exemption from the SEC under Rule l7D-l under the
l940 Act, if required, and in accordance with other applicable law.
          In pursuing this investment philosophy, each Reporting
Person will continuously assess the Issuer's business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects, general economic
conditions, the securities markets in general and those for the
Issuer's securities in particular, other developments and other
investment opportunities, as well as the investment objectives and
diversification requirements of its shareholders or clients and its
fiduciary duties to such shareholders or clients.  Depending on
such assessments, one or more of the Reporting Persons may acquire
additional Securities or may determine to sell or otherwise dispose
of all or some of its holdings of Securities.  Although the
Reporting Persons share the same basic investment philosophy and
although portfolio decisions are made by or under the supervision
of Mr. Gabelli, the investment objectives and diversification
requirements of various clients differ from those of other clients
so that one or more Reporting Persons may be acquiring Securities
while others are disposing of Securities.
          With respect to voting of the Securities, the Reporting
Persons have adopted general voting policies relating to voting on
specified issues affecting corporate governance and shareholder
values.  Under these policies, the Reporting Persons generally vote
all securities over which they have voting power in favor of
cumulative voting, financially reasonable golden parachutes, one
share one vote, management cash incentives and pre-emptive rights
and against greenmail, poison pills, supermajority voting, blank
check preferred stock and super-dilutive stock options.  Exceptions
may be made when management otherwise demonstrates superior sen-
sitivity to the needs of shareholders.  In the event that the
aggregate voting position of all joint filers shall exceed 25% of
the total voting position of the issuer then the proxy voting
committees of each of the Funds shall vote their Fund's shares
independently.
          Each of the Covered Persons who is not a Reporting Person
has purchased the Securities reported herein as beneficially owned
by him for investment for his own account or that of one or more
members of his immediate family. Each such person may acquire
additional Securities or dispose of some or all of the Securities
reported herein with respect to him. 
          Other than as described above, none of the Reporting
Persons and none of the Covered Persons who is not a Reporting
Person has any present plans or proposals which relate to or would
result in any transaction, change or event specified in clauses (a)
through (j) of Item 4 of the Schedule 13D form. 

Item 5.   Interest In Securities Of The Issuer
          (a)  The aggregate number and percentage of Securities to
which this Schedule 13D relates is 771,800 shares, representing
9.09 % of the 8,490,020 shares outstanding as reported in the Issu-

          (b) Each of the Reporting Persons and Covered Persons has
the sole power to vote or direct the vote and sole power to dispose
or to direct the disposition of the Securities reported for it,
either for its own benefit or for the benefit of its investment
clients or its partners, as the case may be, except that (i) GAMCO
Investors, Inc. does not have authority to vote 43,500 of the
reported shares, (ii) GFI has sole dispositive and voting power
with respect to the shares of the Issuer held by the Funds so long
as the aggregate voting interest of all joint filers does not
exceed 25% of their total voting interest in the Issuer and, in
that event, the Proxy Voting Committee of each Fund shall respec-
tively vote that Fund's shares, (iii) at any time, the Proxy Voting
Committee of each such Fund may take and exercise in its sole
discretion the entire voting power with respect to the shares held
by such fund under special circumstances such as regulatory
considerations, and (iv) the power of Mr. Gabelli and GFI is
indirect with respect to Securities beneficially owned directly by
other Reporting Persons. 
          (c) Information with respect to all transactions in the
Securities which were effected during the past sixty days by each
of the Reporting Persons and Covered Persons is set forth on
Schedule II annexed hereto and incorporated herein by refer-
ence.          
          (d) The investment advisory clients of GFI and GAMCO, the
partners of the various partnerships managed by  Mr. Gabelli and
GSI (including GPP, Gabelli Associates, ALCE, and Multimedia
Partners to the extent of their economic interest there-in) and the
shareholders of GIL and GIL II which Mr. Gabelli manages and GAL
which is managed by GSI have the sole right to receive and, subject
to the notice, withdrawal and/or termination provisions of such
advisory contracts and partnership arrangements, the sole power to
direct the receipt of dividends from, and the proceeds of sale of,
any of the Securities beneficially owned by such Reporting Persons. 
Except as noted, no such client or partner has an interest by
virtue of such relationship that relates to more than 5% of the
Securities.  Neither Mr. Gabelli nor GFI nor any of such other
Reporting Persons has an economic interest in any of the Securities
reported herein except those reported as being directly owned by
GFI, GAMCO, Mr. Gabelli, Gabelli & Company, GSI, GIL, GIL II, GAL,
