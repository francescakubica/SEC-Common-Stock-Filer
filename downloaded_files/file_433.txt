	This Amendment No. 3 to Schedule 13-D is filed by Pacholder Associates, Inc. 
("PAI") to amend and update its Schedule 13-D dated January 10, 1996 (as 
amended March 28,l996 and September 27, 1996) relative to the Common Stock 
$0.01 par value of PremiumWear, Inc. (fka Munsingwear, Inc.).  Items not 
included in this Amendment are either not amended or not applicable.

Item 4.    Purpose of Transaction

     Since April 1, 1994, PAI has acted as financial advisor to the PBGC in the 
voting, acquisition or sale of securities of the Company.  The PBGC obtained 
250,000 shares of the Company in exchange for pre-petition claims held by the 
PBGC in the Company, pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization filed by the 
Company and approved by the Bankruptcy Court in September, 1991.

     As financial advisor to the PBGC, PAI is considering various methods by 
which the value of the shares it manages could be enhanced.  PAI will meet with 
management of the Company or other significant shareholders concerning such 
matters.  Any determination by PAI to take any of the actions listed in sub 
(a) - (j) below will be based on various factors, including but not limited to, 
the Company's financial condition, business and prospects, other developments 
concerning the Company, price levels of the Company's common stock, other 
opportunities available to the PBGC, general economic, monetary and stock 
market conditions, and other applicable business and legal considerations.

     William J. Morgan, the President and a Director of PAI resigned from the 
Company's Board of Directors effective June 30, 1997.

     Except as set forth above, PAI has no plans or proposals which relate to 
or would result in any of the following:

     (a)    The acquisition of securities or the disposition of securities of 
     the Company;

     (b)    An extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, 
     reorganization or liquidation, involving the Company or any of its 
     subsidiaries;

     (c)    A sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the Company 
     or any of its subsidiaries;

     (d)    Any change in the present board of directors or management of the 
     Company, including any plans or proposals to change the number or term of 
     directors or to fill any existing vacancies on the Board;

     (e)    Any material change in the present capitalization or dividend 
     policy of the Company;

     (f)    Any other material change in the Company's business or corporate 
     structure;

     (g)    Changes in the Company's charter, bylaws or instruments 
     corresponding thereto or other actions which may impede the acquisition 
     or control of the issuer by any person;

     (h)    Causing a class of securities to be delisted from a national 
     securities exchange or to cease to be authorized to be quoted in an 
     interdealer quotation system of a registered national securities 
     association;

     (i)    A class of equity securities of the Company becoming eligible for 
     termination of registration pursuant to Section 12(g)(4) of the Act; or

     (j)    Any action similar to any of those enumerated above.
