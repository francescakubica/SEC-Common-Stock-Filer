                  Barone, as controlling  stockholder,  Chairman of the Board of
                  Directors  and  President  of RMI,  is deemed to have the same

                  outstanding  shares of Common Stock  represented  thereby have
                  been  computed  in  accordance   with  Rule  13d-3  under  the
                  Securities  Exchange  Act of  1934,  as  amended.  There  were
                  4,421,668 shares of Common Stock outstanding at June 30, 1997,
                  as reported in the  Company's  Registration  Statement on Form
                  S-8 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission July 23,
                  1997.

                           (b). RMI has the sole power to (i) vote or direct the
                  voting of, and (ii) dispose or direct the  disposition  of the
                  390,000 shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by it.

                           (c).  The  transactions  with  respect  to  shares of
                  Common Stock effected by the Reporting  Persons in the past 60
                  days are as set forth below. All such  transactions  were open
