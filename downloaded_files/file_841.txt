                   On February 20, 1996, the Fund acquired  1,850,001  shares of
Common Stock for a purchase price of NLG 64.30 per share,  raising the number of
shares  of  Common   Stock   beneficially   owned  by  the  Fund  to   6,727,314
(approximately  5.42%  of  the  aggregate  number  of  shares  outstanding)  and
requiring  the Fund to file this  statement on Schedule 13D. From February 23 to
March 1, 1996, the Fund acquired an additional 53,151 shares of Common Stock, as
described in more detail in Item 5 below, raising the number of shares of Common
Stock  beneficially owned by the Fund to 6,780,465  (approximately  5.46% of the
aggregate number of shares outstanding).

                  The funds for the  foregoing  purchase of shares of the Common
Stock  by  the  Fund  were  supplied   from  Dutch  public  sector   pensioners'
contributions to the Fund.


Item 4.   Purpose of Transaction.

                  The Fund has  acquired  the  Common  Stock for the  purpose of
making  an  investment  in the  Issuer  and not with the  present  intention  of
acquiring control of the Issuer's business.

                  The Fund from time to time intends to review its investment in
the Issuer on the basis of various  factors,  including  the Issuer's  business,
financial condition,  results of operations and prospects,  general economic and
industry  conditions,  the  securities  markets  in  general  and  those for the
Issuer's  securities  in  particular,  as well as other  developments  and other
investment opportunities.  Based on such review, the Fund will take such actions
in the  future as the Fund may deem  appropriate  in light of the  circumstances
existing from time to time. If the Fund believes that further  investment in the
Issuer is  attractive,  whether  because  of the  market  price of the  Issuer's
securities  or  otherwise,  it may  acquire  shares  of  Common  Stock  or other
securities  of the Issuer  either in the open market or in privately  negotiated
transactions.  Similarly,  depending on market and other  factors,  the Fund may
determine to dispose of some or all of the Common Stock  currently  owned by the
Fund or otherwise acquired by the Fund either in the open market or in privately
negotiated transactions.

                   Except as set forth above,  the Fund has not  formulated  any
plans or proposals which relate to or would result in: (a) the acquisiton by any
person of additional  securities of the Issuer or the  disposition of securities
of the Issuer, (b) an extraordinary  corporate  transaction involving the Issuer
or any of its  subsidiaries,  (c) a sale or transfer of a material amount of the
assets of the Issuer or any of its  subsidiaries,  (d) any change in the present
board of directors or  managment of the Issuer,  (e) any material  change in the
Issuer's capitalization or dividend policy, (f) any other material change in the
Issuer's business or corporate structure, (g) any change in the Issuer's charter
or bylaws or other  instrument  corresponding  thereto or other action which may
impede the  acquisiton  of control of the Issuer by any  person,  (h)  causing a
class of the Issuer's securities to be deregistered or delisted,  (i) a class of
equity   securities  of  the  Issuer   becoming   eligible  for  termination  of
registration or (j) any action similar to any of those enumerated above.
