ITEM 1.  SECURITY AND ISSUER
     This schedule relates to the common stock, $0.01 par value (the "Common
Stock") of MK Rail Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("MK Rail").  The
principal executive offices of MK Rail are located at 1200 Reedsdale Street,
Pittsburgh, PA 15233.

ITEM 2.  IDENTITY AND BACKGROUND
     (a)       This Schedule 13D is being filed by (a) CS First Boston
Securities Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("CSFBSC"), as the beneficial
owner of 1,885,099 shares of Common Stock and (b) CS First Boston, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("CSFBI"), which may be deemed the beneficial owner of
1,940,099 shares of Common Stock by virtue of its ownership of 100 percent of
the outstanding capital stock of CSFBSC and CS First Boston Corporation
("CSFBC"). CSFBSC and CSFBI are collectively referred to herein as the
"Reporting Persons."
     CSFBSC is a dealer in commercial paper, other exempt securities and
derivative products such as interest rate swaps, and invests in certain other
assets. CSFBSC is also a holding company for various subsidiaries. CSFBI is a
holding company whose subsidiaries are principally engaged in the business of
investment banking and broker-dealer activities. All of the outstanding voting
common stock of CSFBI and approximately 69% of the outstanding non-voting common
stock of CSFBI are owned by CS Holding, a Swiss corporation having its
registered offices at Nuschelerstrasse 1, CH-8021 Zurich, Switzerland. The
principal business of CS Holding is acting as a holding company for a group of
companies in the financial services and energy business offering a comprehensive
range of products. Through its ownership of common stock of CSFBI, CS Holding,
for purposes of the federal securities laws, may be deemed to ultimately control
CSFBI. CS Holding, its executive officers and directors and its direct and
indirect subsidiaries, in addition to the Reporting Persons, may beneficially
own Common Stock and such ownership is not reported in this Statement. CS
Holding disclaims beneficial ownership of Common Stock beneficially owned by its
direct and indirect subsidiaries, including the Reporting Persons. CSFBI hereby
undertakes to amend this Statement, if necessary, to include the information
required by Items 3 through 6 of Schedule 13D with respect to any Common Stock
that may be beneficially owned by the executive officers or directors of CS
Holding.
     (b)       The principal business address of each of CSFBI and CSFBSC is
Park Avenue Plaza, 55 East 52nd Street, New York, New York 10055.
     (c), (f)  The name, citizenship, residence or business address and present
principal occupation or employment, and the name, principal business and address
of any corporation or other organization in which such employment is conducted,
of each executive officer and director of CSFBI, CSFBSC and CS Holding is set
forth on Schedule I hereto, which Schedule is hereby incorporated herein by
reference in its entirety.
     (d)-(e)   Neither of the Reporting Persons and, to the knowledge of the
Reporting Persons, neither CS Holding nor any of the executive officers and
directors listed on Schedule I hereto, has, during the last five years, (i) been
convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar
misdemeanors) or (ii) been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or
administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding
was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future
violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or
state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws.

ITEM 3.  SOURCE AND AMOUNT OF FUNDS OR OTHER CONSIDERATION
     Pursuant to an order of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District
of Delaware, dated August 26, 1996, the First Amended Plan of Reorganization of
Morrison Knudsen Corporation ("MKC") under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code
(the "Plan") was confirmed.  Under the Plan, CSFBSC became entitled to receive
1,885,099 shares of Common Stock (the "Aggregate Proceeds"), comprised of
927,171 shares on account of debt owed by MKC and 957,928 shares on account of
debt owed by American Passenger Rail Company, L.L.C., a Delaware limited
liability company ("APRC"), an affiliate of MKC (the "APRC Proceeds").  The
Aggregate Proceeds and the APRC Proceeds include 519,542 shares (the "Nomura
Proceeds") which CSFBSC became entitled to receive under the Plan on behalf of
Nomura Holding America, Inc. ("Nomura") as a result of purchases of debt owed by
APRC made pursuant to an oral

  CUSIP NO. 55305T102            SCHEDULE 13D              PAGE 5 OF 15 PAGES
- -----------------------                                  ---------------------
 
agreement entered into between CSFBSC and Nomura in June 1996 (the "Nomura
Agreement").  Under the Nomura Agreement, CSFBSC has agreed to irrevocably
transfer, assign and convey to Nomura specified percentages of the debt owed by
APRC and purchased by CSFBSC at various times, or the proceeds thereof (which
constitute the Nomura Proceeds), upon the payment to CSFBSC by Nomura of the
specified percentages of CSFBSC's actual cost of the related purchases, plus an
amount based on CSFBSC's cost of carry of such purchases from the dates of such
purchases.
     CSFBC acts as a market maker for the Common Stock.  As of the filing date,
CSFBC held 55,000 shares of Common Stock in its trading account, acquired from
time to time in open market transactions in the ordinary course of its market
making activities, using working capital funds.  CSFBI, through its 100 percent
ownership of the outstanding capital stock of CSFBC, may be deemed to share the
power to vote or direct the vote and dispose or direct the disposition of the
shares of Common Stock held in CSFBC's trading account pursuant to its market
making activities.

ITEM 4.  PURPOSE OF TRANSACTION
     CSFBSC became entitled to receive 1,885,099 shares of Common Stock in the
manner described in Item 3 above.  CSFBI may be deemed to have become entitled
to receive 1,885,099 shares of Common Stock through its 100 percent ownership of
the outstanding capital stock of CSFBSC in the manner described in Item 3 above
and may also be deemed to beneficially own 55,000 shares of Common Stock through
its 100 percent ownership of the outstanding capital stock of CSFBC.  Except as
described below and in Items 3 and 5, the Reporting Persons have no plans or
proposals that would result in (1) the acquisition by any person of additional
securities of MK Rail or the disposition of securities of MK Rail; (2) an
extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or
liquidation of MK Rail or any of its subsidiaries; (3) a sale or transfer of a
material amount of assets of MK Rail or any of its subsidiaries; (4) any change
in the present board of directors or management of MK Rail, including any plans
or proposals to change the number or term of directors or to fill any existing
vacancies on the board of directors of MK Rail; (5) any material change in the
present capitalization or dividend policy of MK Rail; (6) any other material
change in the business or corporate structure of MK Rail; (7) changes in the
charter, by-laws or instruments corresponding thereto of MK Rail, or other
actions which may impede the acquisition of control of MK Rail by any person;
(8) any class of securities of MK Rail being delisted from a national securities
exchange or ceasing to be authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation
system of a registered national securities association; (9) any class of equity
securities of MK Rail becoming eligible for termination of registration pursuant
to Section 12(g)(4) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("the
Exchange Act"); or (10) any action similar to any of those enumerated above.
The Reporting Persons, however, reserve the right to change their plans or
intentions at any time and to take any and all actions that they deem
appropriate to maximize the value of their investment including, among other
things, from time to time increasing or decreasing the number of shares of
Common Stock by acquiring additional shares, or by disposing of all or a portion
of the shares of Common Stock in open market or privately negotiated
transactions or otherwise, depending on existing market conditions and other
considerations discussed below.  The Reporting Persons intend to review their
investment in MK Rail on a continuing basis and, depending upon the price and
availability of Common Stock, subsequent developments affecting MK Rail, the
general business and future prospects of MK Rail, other investment and business
opportunities available to the Reporting Persons, general stock market and
economic conditions, tax considerations and other factors considered relevant,
may decide at any time to increase or decrease the size of their investment in
MK Rail.
     CSFBSC intends to transfer its shares of Common Stock to CSFBC in the
ordinary course of business. CSFBC intends to continue to engage in purchase and
sale transactions in the Common Stock through its trading account in connection
with its market making activities.

ITEM 5.  INTEREST IN SECURITIES OF THE ISSUER
     (a) Following the consummation of the Plan on September 14, 1996, CSFBSC
became entitled to receive 1,885,099 shares of Common Stock, which constitute
10.7% of the shares of Common Stock estimated to be outstanding as of September
14, 1996.  The Nomura Proceeds, which constitute 3.0% of the shares of Common
Stock estimated to be outstanding as of September 14, 1996, included in such
total number of shares were acquired on behalf of Nomura under, and are subject
to, the Nomura Agreement, under which CSFBSC has agreed to irrevocably transfer,
assign and convey to Nomura the debt owed by APRC and acquired pursuant to the
Nomura Agreement (which debt represented specified percentages of the total debt
owed by APRC acquired by CSFBSC) upon payment by Nomura of

  CUSIP NO. 55305T102            SCHEDULE 13D              PAGE 6 OF 15 PAGES
- -----------------------                                  ---------------------
 
the specified percentages of CSFBSC's actual cost of the related purchases, plus
an amount based on CSFBSC's cost of carry of such purchases from the dates of
such purchases.   Upon the receipt of payment under the terms of the Nomura
Agreement, CSFBSC will transfer, assign and convey the Nomura Proceeds to
Nomura, and the Reporting Persons will have no further arrangements with Nomura
with respect to the Nomura Proceeds or the securities of MK Rail, except to the
extent the Nomura Proceeds are subject to the Stockholders Agreement described
below.
     The Plan required creditors of MKC, including CSFBSC, to be bound by the
terms of a Stockholders Agreement dated as of June 20, 1996, and as amended by
the First Amendment to the Stockholders Agreement dated as of July 25, 1996,
between MK Rail and MKC (the "Stockholders Agreement").  Under the Stockholders
Agreement, no person who receives shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Plan
may transfer any shares of Common Stock to any person except under certain
circumstances.  The restrictions on transfers under the Stockholders Agreement
will not apply to any subsequent transferee so long as the transfer was
permitted under the Stockholders Agreement.  Pursuant to the Stockholders
Agreement, certain persons, including CSFBSC, have agreed not to (a) solicit
proxies, (b) initiate any stockholder proposal for a tender offer, change of
control or attempt to convene stockholders meeting or (c) otherwise seek to
influence or control the management or policies of MK Rail.  The above
restrictions expire on the second anniversary of the distribution of the Common
Stock under the Plan (subject to certain alternate termination provisions).
     The Stockholders Agreement provides that the shares of Common Stock
received by CSFBSC and the other stockholders bound thereby (the "Stockholders")
must be voted for certain nominees for election to MK Rail's board of directors.
The Reporting Persons and the Stockholders may be deemed to constitute a group

the Stockholders Agreement, certain holders may demand that MK Rail file a
registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act") for the resale of the Common Stock received by such holders in
accordance with the Plan or, if MK Rail has filed a registration statement
pursuant to the Securities Act, such holders may include shares of Common Stock
received in accordance with the Plan on MK Rail's registration statement.
     As of the filing date, CSFBC, the principal business of which is investment
banking and registered broker-dealer activities, held 55,000 shares of Common
Stock in its trading account in connection with its market making activities.
CSFBI, through its 100 percent ownership of the outstanding capital stock of
CSFBSC and CSFBC, may be deemed to beneficially own 1,940,099 shares of Common
Stock, which constitute 11.1% of the shares of Common Stock estimated to be
outstanding as of September 14, 1996.
     (b) CSFBSC, through its ownership of 1,885,099 shares of Common Stock, and
CSFBI, through its ownership of 100 percent of the outstanding capital stock of
CSFBSC, may be deemed to share the power to vote or direct the vote and dispose
or direct the disposition of 1,885,099 shares of Common Stock.  CSFBI, through
its ownership of 100 percent of the outstanding capital stock of CSFBC, may also
be deemed to share the power to vote or direct the vote and dispose or direct
the disposition of an additional 55,000 shares of Common Stock held by CSFBC
pursuant to its market making activities.
     (c) During the past 60 days, the Reporting Persons have not effected any
transactions relating to the Common Stock, except as described below and in
Items 3 and 5(a).  During the past 60 days, CSFBC has effectuated six
