Item 5.  Interest in Securities of Issuer.

         (a)  Based on the Issuer's Form 10-Q for the period
              ending March 31, 1997, dated May 15, 1997, there
              were 16,815,314 shares of Common Stock outstanding.
              As of September 1, 1997, the Investment Manager was
              deemed to be the beneficial owner of 100,000
              Warrants exercisable for 100,000 shares of Common
              Stock and 35,000 shares of Series D Convertible
              Preferred Stock (the "Preferred Stock) of which
              26,250 shares are currently convertible into
              1,809,835 shares of Common Stock (including shares
              representing accrued interest) based on a currently
              effective conversion price of $1.50 per share of
              Common Stock (the "Conversion Price").  The
              Investment Manager also owns 210,000 other
              Warrants, 70,000 of which are exercisable on
              12/31/97, 70,000 of which are exercisable on
              12/31/98 and 70,000 of which are exercisable on
              12/31/99.  The terms by which to determine the
              Conversion Price are set forth in the Issuer's Form
              10-Q for the period ending March 31, 1997, filed
              with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
              "Commission") on May 15, 1997, Commission File
              Number 0-19218 (the "10-Q Exhibit").  Assuming the
              exercise of the Warrants and the conversion of the
              Preferred Stock, the Investment Manager would be
              deemed to be the beneficial owner of 1,909,835
              shares of Common Stock constituting 10.2% of the
              Issuer's Common Stock based upon 18,725,149 shares
              that would be outstanding upon exercise of the
              Warrants and conversion of the Preferred Stock.  As
              of September 1, 1997, the Fund was deemed to be the
              beneficial owner of 24,500 shares of Preferred
              Stock of which 18,375 shares are currently
              convertible into 1,266,884 shares of Common Stock
              (including shares representing accrued interest)
              based on the Conversion Price, as discussed above.
              Assuming the conversion of the Preferred Stock, the
              Fund would be deemed to be the beneficial owner of
              1,266,884 shares of Common Stock constituting 7.01%
              of the Issuer's Common Stock based upon 18,082,198
              shares that would be outstanding upon conversion of
              the Preferred Stock.  The Reporting Persons do not
              intend to amend this Schedule 13D solely because
              possible future changes in the Conversion Price may
              result in their being deemed to beneficially own a
              different number or percentage of outstanding
              shares of Common Stock than reported herein.

         (b)  The Reporting Persons share the power to vote and
              dispose of all of the shares of which they are both

                                6



<PAGE>

              deemed to be the beneficial owners, and the
              Investment Manager has the sole power to vote and
              dispose of the remainder of the shares of which he
              is deemed to be the beneficial owner.

         (c)  Not applicable.

         (d)  No other person is known to have the right to
              receive or the power to direct the receipt of
              dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of
              the Preferred Stock and Warrants.

         (e)  Not applicable.

Item 6.  Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or
         Relationships with Respect to Securities of the Issuer

         Except as described herein, there are no contracts,
         arrangements, understandings or relationships between
         the persons named in Item 2 hereof or between such
         persons and any other person with respect to any
         securities of the Issuer.

Item 7.  Material to be Filed as Exhibits.

         Exhibit A:   Joint Filing Agreement.

         Other:       The 10-Q Exhibit is incorporated
                      herein by reference.

         Signature

         After reasonable inquiry and to the best of my
knowledge and belief, I certify that the information set
forth in this statement is true, complete and correct.
