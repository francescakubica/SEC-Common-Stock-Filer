and TBK Partners, L.P. ("TBK"), which group may be deemed to be the beneficial
owner in the aggregate of in excess of 5% of the Common Stock of J. Michaels,

ITEM 3.  SOURCE AND AMOUNTS OF FUNDS OR OTHER CONSIDERATION

       As of the date hereof, the number of shares with respect to which TBC may
be deemed to be the beneficial owner is 22,953 shares of Common Stock (the "TBC
Shares"), all of which shares were purchased in open market transactions. The
aggregate cost of the TBC Shares, including brokerage commissions, was $143,299.

       The TBC Shares are held in the TBC Accounts, the funds therefor coming
from the funds on hand in each individual managed account and in certain
instances from standard margin account borrowings from brokerage accounts
maintained at Fleet Clearing Corporation. It is expected that funds used by the
TBC Accounts to purchase additional shares of Common Stock, if additional shares
are purchased by the TBC Accounts (see Item 4 hereof), will come from the funds
on hand for each individual managed account, which funds on hand at any time and
from time to time may include, among others, funds borrowed pursuant to margin
accounts maintained at Fleet Clearing Corporation. Borrowings made by certain
TBC Accounts pursuant to such margin accounts are secured by margin securities
owned by the respective accounts, including some of the TBC Shares. Interest on
outstanding borrowings under such margin accounts ranges from 1/2% to 2% over
the brokers' call rate in effect from time to time at Chemical Bank, New York,
New York, depending upon the amount of outstanding borrowings at any given time.

       As of the date hereof, TBK beneficially owns directly 31,300 shares of
Common Stock (the "TBK Shares"), all of which shares were purchased in open
market transactions. (TBK and certain of the general partners in TBK, who are
also general partners of TBC may also be deemed to be the indirect beneficial
owners of certain other shares of Common Stock, as set forth in Item 5 hereof.)
The aggregate cost of the TBK Shares, including brokerage commissions, was
$231,720.

       It is expected that funds used by TBK to purchase additional shares of
Common Stock, if additional shares are purchased by TBK (see Item 4 hereof),
will come from TBK's general funds, which include cash and cash equivalents on
hand and in banks.
<PAGE>   7
       TBK's general funds have included, and it is expected that they will from
time to time include, funds borrowed by it pursuant to an understanding with
Chemical Bank. As of the date hereof, TBK has a loan outstanding with Chemical
Bank in the amount of $20,000.00. Borrowings made by TBK pursuant to that
understanding bear interest at the brokers' call rate in effect from time to
time at Chemical Bank. TBK's funds on hand have also included, and it is
expected that they will from time to time include, funds borrowed by it pursuant
to an understanding with The Bank of New York, New York, New York. Pursuant to
that understanding, TBK may borrow funds at the brokers' call rate charged from
time to time by The Bank of New York. As of the date hereof, TBK has a loan
outstanding with The Bank of New York in the amount of $10,000.00. Borrowings
made by TBK pursuant to its understandings with Chemical Bank and The Bank of
New York are secured by securities owned by TBK; such borrowings are not secured
by any TBK Shares. No borrowings from Chemical Bank or The Bank of New York were
made for the purpose of acquiring the TBK Shares. TBK reserves the right to
include all or any of the shares of Common Stock owned by it at any time or from
time to time, among the securities that serve as collateral for such borrowings,
subject to compliance with any applicable statutes and regulations.

ITEM 4.  PURPOSE OF TRANSACTION

       Each of TBC and TBK has acquired the shares of Common Stock owned by it
for investment purposes and for none of the reasons enumerated in Item 4 of
Schedule 13D, except that TBC and TBK may dispose of all or some of the TBC
Shares and the TBK Shares, respectively, or may acquire additional shares of
Common Stock from time to time, depending upon price and market conditions,
evaluation of alternative investments, and other factors. Currently, TBC and TBK
intend to acquire additional shares of Common Stock in the open market,
depending upon the price of the Common Stock from time to time.

ITEM 5.  INTEREST IN SECURITIES OF THE ISSUER

       (a)  As of the date hereof, TBC may be deemed to be the beneficial owner
of an aggregate of 22,953 shares of Common Stock, which constitutes
approximately 2.70% of the 851,285 shares of Common Stock which TBC believes to
be the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. The TBC Shares are
held in the TBC Accounts.

       Also included in the TBC Shares are 600 shares of Common Stock held in a
certain TBC Account, of which John D. Spears, a general partner in TBC and TBK,
may be deemed to beneficially own directly.

       As of the date hereof, TBK beneficially owns directly 31,300 shares of
Common Stock, which constitutes approximately 3.68% of the 851,285 shares of
Common Stock which TBK believes to be the total number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding.

       Each of TBC and TBK disclaims that it is the beneficial owner of any of
the shares of Common Stock held in the TBC Accounts. The aggregate number of
shares of Common Stock with respect to which TBC and TBK could be deemed to be
the beneficial owner as of the date hereof, is 54,253 shares, which constitutes
approximately 6.37% of the 851,285 shares of Common Stock, which the filing
persons believe to be the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding,
but nothing contained herein shall be construed as an admission that TBC is the
beneficial owner of any of the TBC Shares.

       The aggregate number of shares and percentage of Common Stock with
respect to which each of the General Partners may be deemd to be the beneficial
