     As of the date hereof, the number of shares with respect to which TBC may
be deemed to be the beneficial owner is 449,255 shares of Common Stock (the "TBC
Shares"), all of which shares were purchased in open market transactions. The
aggregate cost of the TBC Shares, including brokerage commissions, was
$2,384,791.

     The TBC Shares are held in the TBC Accounts, the funds therefor coming from
the funds on hand in each individual managed account and in certain instances
from standard margin account borrowings from brokerage accounts maintained at
Fleet Clearing Corporation. It is expected that funds used by the TBC Accounts
to purchase additional shares of Common Stock, if additional shares are
purchased by the TBC Accounts (see Item 4 hereof), will come from the funds on
hand for each individual managed account, which funds on hand at any time and
from time to time may include, among others, funds borrowed pursuant to margin
accounts maintained at Fleet Clearing Corporation. Borrowings made by certain
TBC Accounts pursuant to such margin accounts are secured by margin securities
owned by the respective accounts, including some of the TBC Shares. Interest on
outstanding borrowings under such margin accounts ranges from 1/2% to 2% over
the brokers' call rate in effect from time to time at Chase Manhattan Bank, New
York, New York, depending upon the amount of outstanding borrowings at any given
time.

     As of the date hereof, TBK beneficially owns directly 10,000 shares of
Common Stock (the "TBK Shares"), all of which shares were purchased in open
market transactions. The aggregate cost of the TBK Shares, including brokerage
commissions, was $52,743.

     It is expected that funds used by TBK to purchase additional shares of
Common Stock, if additional shares are purchased by TBK (see Item 4 hereof),
will come from TBK's general funds, which include cash and cash equivalents on
hand and in banks.

     TBK's general funds have included, and it is expected that they will from
time to time include, funds borrowed by it pursuant to an understanding with
Chase Manhattan Bank. As of the date hereof, TBK has a loan outstanding with
Chase Manhattan Bank in the amount of $20,000. Borrowings made by TBK pursuant
to that understanding bear interest at the brokers' call rate in effect from

time to time at Chase Manhattan Bank. TBK's funds may also include funds
borrowed pursuant to a Line of Credit Agreement between TBK and Boston Safe
Deposit and Trust Company. Pursuant to the Line of Credit Agreement, TBK may
borrow up to $15,000,000 at the brokers' call rate charged from time to time by
Boston Safe Deposit & Trust Company. Borrowings made by TBK pursuant to its
understandings with Chase Manhattan Bank and the Line of Credit Agreement with
Boston Safe Deposit and Trust Company are secured by securities owned by TBK;
such borrowings are not secured by any TBK Shares. No borrowings from Chase
Manhattan Bank or Boston Safe Deposit and Trust Company were made for the
purpose of acquiring the TBK Shares. TBK reserves the right to include all or
any of the shares of Common Stock owned by it at any time or from time to time,
among the securities that serve as collateral for such borrowings, subject to
compliance with any applicable statutes and regulations.

     As of the date hereof, Vanderbilt beneficially owns directly 4,000 shares
of Common Stock (the "Vanderbilt Shares"), all of which shares were purchased in
open market transactions hereof.) The aggregate cost of the Vanderbilt Shares,
including brokerage commissions, was $21,156.

     It is expected that funds used by Vanderbilt to purchase additional shares
of Common Stock, if additional shares are purchased by Vanderbilt (see Item 4
hereof), will come from Vanderbilt's general funds, which include cash and cash
equivalents on hand and in banks.

     Vanderbilt's funds may include funds borrowed pursuant to a Line of Credit
Agreement between Vanderbilt and Boston Safe Deposit and Trust Company. Pursuant
to the Line of Credit Agreement, Vanderbilt may borrow up to $2,000,000 at the
brokers' call rate charged from time to time by Boston Safe Deposit & Trust
Company. Borrowings made by Vanderbilt pursuant to the Line of Credit Agreement
with Boston Safe Deposit and Trust Company are secured by securities owned by
Vanderbilt; such borrowings are not secured by any Vanderbilt Shares. No
borrowings from Boston Safe Deposit and Trust Company were made by Vanderbilt
for the purpose of acquiring the Vanderbilt Shares. Vanderbilt reserves the
right to include all or any of the shares of Common Stock owned by it at any
time or from time to time, among the securities that serve as collateral for
such borrowings, subject to compliance with any applicable statutes and
regulations.
