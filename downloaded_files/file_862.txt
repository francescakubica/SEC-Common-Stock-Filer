     registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("PCA"),
     PCB purchased a total of 24,500 Shares in open market

     brokers' commissions) of $1,941,150.00.  To the best knowledge

     unincorporated trust governed by the laws of British Columbia

                                                              Page 9

     (which is the continuation of and successor to Cundill Value
     Fund Ltd.) ("Value Fund"), PCB purchased a total of 63,500
     Shares in open market transactions for an aggregate
     consideration (exclusive of brokers' commissions) of
     $5,388,150.00.  To the best knowledge of the Reporting
     Persons, the funds used in such purchases were from Value
     Fund's existing available investment capital, and none of the
     consideration for such Shares was represented by borrowed
     funds.

          (3)  Acting on behalf of Global Advisors Portfolio II
     N.V., a corporation organized under the laws of Netherlands
     Antilles ("Global Advisors"), PCB purchased a total of 2,000
     Shares in open market transactions for an aggregate
     consideration (exclusive of brokers' commissions) of
     $146,675.00.  To the best knowledge of the Reporting Persons,
     the funds used in such purchases were from Global Advisor's
     existing available investment capital, and none of the
     consideration for such Shares was represented by borrowed
     funds.

          (4)  Acting on behalf of Cundill International Company,
     Ltd., a mutual fund corporation incorporated under the laws of
     Bermuda ("International"), PCB purchased a total of 7,000
     Shares in open market transactions for an aggregate
     consideration (exclusive of brokers' commissions) of
     $603,312.50.  To the best knowledge of the Reporting Persons,

     open market transactions, for an aggregate consideration
     (exclusive of brokers' commissions) of $435,312.50.  To the

     such purchases were from existing available investment capital
     and none of the consideration for such Shares was represented
     by borrowed funds.

          Individually PCB does not beneficially own 5% or more of
the Shares.  Due to the investment management services provided by
PCB to PCA, Value Fund, Global Advisors, International and Cundill
Capital, PCB could be deemed a beneficial owner of all Shares
purchased in the transaction described in subitems (1), (2), (3),
(4) and (5) above.

Item 4.   Purpose of Transactions.
- ------    -----------------------

          The Shares were acquired with a view toward realizing a
profit.  The Reporting Persons expect to monitor the Company's
performance by, among other things, having discussions from time to
time with management, employees and/or directors of the Company,
other shareholders, market and business analysts, and others.
Depending on various factors which they deem relevant, the
Reporting Persons may hold the Shares, buy more Shares or sell some
or all of the Shares from time to time.

          The Reporting Persons previously supported a proposed
settlement filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery in the action
captioned Ronald S. Haft v. Dart Group Corporation, Alan Kahn and
          -------------------------------------------------------
the Tudor Trust, C.A. No. 13736.  However, as a result of the March
- ---------------
10, 1995, withdrawal from the putative settlement by certain
plaintiffs, the Reporting Persons no longer support the proposed
settlement.

the Investment Counsel in the name of the Funds, the Investment
Counsel shall ensure that same does not cause the Funds to be in
contravention of any part of the Master Declaration of Trust, their
investment objectives or their investment policies.

it in reliance upon any notice, resolution, direction, consent,

Counsel in respect of the payment of the Investment Counsel Fee.

                    shall be carried forward to the succeeding
                    quarter and deducted in the calculation of
                    future Incentive Returns and no further
                    Incentive Fee shall be payable until such
                    shortfall, adjusted in respect of further
                    issues of shares, has been completely
                    recovered.

during a fiscal year, shall be paid to the Manager annually within
one month of the fiscal year-end of the Company by the allotment of
Class A shares in the Company.  The Class A shares in the Company
shall be valued at their net asset value on the last day of the

                            ARTICLE 3
                        FEES AND EXPENSES


3.01      FEES
          ----

          The Partnership will pay to the Investment Counsel an
annual incentive fee (the "Incentive Fee") equal to 20% of the
amount by which:

     (a)  the increase in Net Asset Value of the Partnership for
          each fiscal year since the last fiscal year-end, as
          calculated at the close of business on each fiscal
          year-end, adjusted for contributions and redemptions made
          by the Limited Partners and for any Shortfall (as defined
          below) from the previous fiscal year, (the "Incentive
          Return"), exceeds

     (b)  the return that would be generated annually by the
          average interest rate (the "Average Rate") applied to the
          Net Asset Value of the Partnership as calculated at the
          close of business of the previous fiscal year-end of the
          Partnership, adjusted for contributions and redemptions
          made by the Limited Partners (the "Base Return").  The
          Average Rate shall be the average of the amount
          calculated in respect of each month during the fiscal
          period which is the average of the rate of interest

                                    (5)
<PAGE> 50
          payable on 30 day certificates of deposit of amounts of
          $100,000 offered by the main branch of the Bank of
          Montreal in Vancouver, British Columbia, on the first and
          last days of that month.

          If in any fiscal year the Incentive Return is less than
the Base Return, no Incentive Fee shall be paid for that fiscal
year and the difference between the Base Return and the Incentive
Return (the "Shortfall") shall be carried forward to the succeeding
fiscal year and, after adjustment for redemptions, deducted in the
calculation of the Incentive Return for that year.  The Shortfall
deducted in any year shall be reduced by an amount such that the
proportion that the reduction bears to the Shortfall is equal to
the proportion that the number of Units which were outstanding at
the end of the previous fiscal year and which are redeemed during
the year bears to the total number of Units outstanding at the end
of the previous fiscal year.


3.02      PAYMENT OF INCENTIVE FEE
          ------------------------

          The Incentive Fee, if any, shall be determined quarterly
during a fiscal year for the purposes of calculating the Net Asset
Value per Unit at the end of each fiscal quarter, but shall be paid
to the Investment Counsel annually within one month of the fiscal
year end of the Partnership from cash held in the Partnership.


3.03      REDUCTION OF INCENTIVE FEE
          --------------------------

          The Incentive Fee payable in respect of any fiscal year
shall be reduced by such amount as is required to avoid the
duplication of any fees paid to the Investment Counsel for that
year in respect of any Securities owned by the Partnership which
are Securities of other funds and portfolios advised by the
Investment Counsel.  For the purposes of calculating the reduction,
such other fees shall be assumed to have accrued evenly over the
fiscal year and shall be pro-rated to reflect the period of
ownership of the Securities by the Partnership.


3.04      DETERMINATION OF NET ASSET VALUE
          --------------------------------

          The following principles shall apply to the determination
of Net Asset Value:

     (a)  marketable Securities listed and traded on securities
          exchanges or in over-the-counter markets shall be
          determined by the closing sale price thereon or, in the
          absence of a sale on the valuation date, by the mean
          between the last closing bid and asked prices of such
          Security on such exchanges or as reported by other
          recognized quotation services;

     (b)  all other assets, including non-marketable Securities,
          shall be valued at their respective fair value as

          the fair value of any marketable Securities or
          instruments would be better reflected by some other
          method of valuation, then that method shall be used.
