of his Individual Retirement Account and (c) in his capacity as (i) one of the

BEM International Ltd., a corporation organized under the laws of Bermuda
("BEM International" and, together with BEM, the "Funds"); and (2) Mark
Metzger ("Mr. Metzger"), a United States citizen, (a) as owner of his
Individual Retirement Account and (b) in his capacity as (i) one of the two
managing general partners of BEM and (ii) vice chairman of BEM International
Management.  Mr. Blau and Mr. Metzger are sometimes collectively referred to
herein as the "Reporting Persons".

                  The third paragraph of this Item 2 is amended in its

Item 5.  Interest in Securities of the Issuer

                  Paragraph (a) - (c) of Item 5 are amended in their entirety
as set forth below.

                  (a)-(b) On the date of this Statement:

                           1.   Mr. Blau has beneficial ownership for purposes
of Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Beneficial
Ownership") and sole voting and dispositive power with respect to 4,000 shares
of Interim Common and Beneficial Ownership of 261,360 shares of Interim Common
by virtue of his position as one of the two managing general partners of BEM
and as one of the two persons responsible, through BEM International
Management, for the management of the assets of BEM International. The
aggregate of such shares (265,360) represent approximately 1.7% of the issued
and outstanding shares of Interim Common. Mr.  Blau shares with Mr. Metzger
voting power and dispositive power over the 261,360 shares of Interim Common
held by the Funds.

                           2.   Mr. Metzger has Beneficial Ownership of
261,360 shares of Interim Common by virtue of his position as one of the two
managing general partners of BEM and as one of the two persons responsible,
through BEM International Management, for managing the assets of BEM
International. Such shares represent approximately 1.6% of the issued and
outstanding Interim Common. Mr. Metzger shares with Mr.  Blau voting power and
dispositive power over these shares of Interim Common held by the Funds.

                           3.  The percentages used herein are calculated
based upon the 15,989,000 shares of Interim Common stated to be the weighted
average shares issued and outstanding for the quarter

<PAGE>7


ended June 28, 1996, as reflected in Interim's unaudited consolidated statement
of earnings released on July 23, 1996.

                   (c) Since the most recent filing on Schedule 13D, Mr. Blau
and Mr. Blau's Individual Retirement Account each purchased 2,000 shares of
Interim Common on March 13, 1996 at $37.50 per share. These purchases were
effected on the Nasdaq. On April 30, 1996, Mr. Metzger's Individual Retirement
Account sold 2,200 shares of Common Stock at $37.63 per share. This sale was
effected on the American Stock Exchange. All prices include commissions. On May
23, 1996, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, the 297,000 shares of
Common Stock held by the Funds were converted into 261,360 shares of Interim
Common.

                  Paragraph (e) of Item 5 is amended in its entirety as set
forth below.

                  The Reporting Persons ceased to have Beneficial Ownership of
more than 5% of the Interim Common on May 23, 1996 when the Company merged into
Interim.
