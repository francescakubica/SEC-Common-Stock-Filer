1997 (the "Second Supplemental Indenture") to an indenture dated

January 2, 1996 (the "Indenture") between INAMED and Santa

for 375,000 shares of Common Stock.  The Common Stock, the Notes

and the Warrants are held by the Funds over which Mr. Feinberg

                                7



<PAGE>




Common Stock, the Notes and the Warrants held in the Funds, over

which Mr. Feinberg has investment discretion, came from capital

contributions to the Funds by their general and limited partners.

The funds for the purchase of the Common Stock, the Notes and the

Warrants held in the Managed Accounts, over which the Mr.

Feinberg has investment discretion, came from each managed

account's own funds.  Leverage was not used to purchase the

Common Stock, Notes or Warrants.

         The Common Stock, the Notes and the Warrants

beneficially owned by the Reporting Persons were acquired for,

and are being held for, investment purposes.  The Reporting

all or some of those shares from time to time, in each case in



                                8



<PAGE>




open market transactions, block sales or purchases or otherwise,

or may continue to hold those shares.

         The Reporting Persons do not have any plan or proposal

which relates to, or would result in, any of the actions

         As of the date hereof, Mr. Feinberg is deemed to be the

beneficial owner of 71,800 shares of Common Stock, Notes

convertible into 727,273 shares of Common Stock and Warrants

exercisable for 375,000 shares of Common Stock.  Assuming the

conversion of the Notes and the exercise of the Warrants, Mr.

Feinberg would be deemed to be the beneficial owner of 1,174,073

shares of Common Stock constituting 12.29% of the shares of

INAMED Common Stock based upon 9,546,939 shares that would be

outstanding upon conversion of the Notes and exercise of the

Warrants.  This figure is based on information received from

INAMED stating that, as of July 28, 1997, there were 8,444,666

shares of Common Stock outstanding.  With respect to 511,773

shares of the INAMED Common Stock Mr. Feinberg is deemed to

beneficially own, Mr. Feinberg and Oracle Partners share the



                                9



<PAGE>




power to vote, direct the vote, dispose of or direct the

disposition of those shares.  Mr. Feinberg  has the sole power to

vote, direct the vote, dispose of or direct the disposition of

the remainder of shares of INAMED Common Stock of which he is

currently deemed to be the beneficial owner.  

    As of the date hereof, Oracle Partners is deemed to be the

beneficial owner of 15,750 shares of Common Stock, Notes

convertible into 327,273 shares of Common Stock and Warrants

exercisable for 168,750 shares of Common Stock.  Assuming the

conversion of the Notes and the exercise of the Warrants, Oracle

Partners would be deemed to be the beneficial owner of 511,773

shares of Common Stock constituting 5.72% of the shares of INAMED

Common Stock based upon 8,941,139 shares that would be

outstanding upon conversion of the Notes and exercise of the

Warrants.  This figure is based on information received from

INAMED stating that, as of July 28, 1997, there were 8,444,666

shares of Common Stock outstanding.  Oracle Partners and Mr.

Feinberg share the power to vote, direct the vote, dispose of or

direct the disposition of the shares of INAMED Common Stock of

which they both are currently deemed to be the beneficial owners. 

Item 6.  CONTRACTS, ARRANGEMENTS, UNDERSTANDINGS OR
         RELATIONSHIPS WITH RESPECT TO SECURITIES OF
         THE ISSUER

         INAMED notified the Funds that certain events caused

material delays in the resolution of a litigation involving



                               10



<PAGE>




INAMED (the "Litigation") for which the Funds had placed monies

in escrow pending a settlement (the "Escrow").  INAMED requested

the Funds' cooperation in amending the Indenture entered into in

connection with the issuance of the Notes to provide for the

release of the monies from Escrow, redeem a portion of the Notes

and establish an alternate source of financing for use in the

future settlement of the Litigation. 

         The Funds entered into a Consent and Waiver with INAMED

(the "Consent and Waiver") to amend the Indenture, thereby

creating the Second Supplemental Indenture, and to waive all past

defaults or events of default by INAMED.  In connection with the

Second Supplemental Indenture, the Funds' monies placed in Escrow

were released, a portion of the Funds' Notes were redeemed and

the conversion price of the remaining Notes was changed, and the

Funds were issued warrants pursuant to a Warrant Agreement dated

July 2, 1997 (the "Warrant Agreement").  Under the Warrant

Agreement, the Funds, in the aggregate, were issued Warrants

representing the right to purchase 375,000 shares of Common Stock

at an exercise price of $8.00 per share.

         [The validity of the Second Supplemental Indenture is

conditioned upon consent to the matters described above by the

holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes through

the Consent and Waivers to amend the Indenture pursuant to the

Consent and Waivers].



                               11



<PAGE>




         Additionally, on January 8, 1997, the Funds, in the

aggregate, received 35,000 shares of Common Stock representing 5%

of the shares of Common Stock that would have been issuable to

the Funds if all Notes had been converted on June 10, 1996.  The

Funds received these shares in exchange for waiving certain

defaults by INAMED that occurred through March 31, 1996.
