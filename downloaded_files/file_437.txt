Item 1.  Security and Issuer

         This statement relates to the Common Stock of The

         Alpine Group, Inc. ("AGI"), a Delaware corporation.

         AGI's principal executive office is located at 1790

         Broadway, New York, New York 1OO19-1412. 



Item 2.  Identity and Background

         This statement is being filed on behalf of Craig A.

         Drill, Craig Drill Capital, L.L.C. (the "L.L.C."),

         a Delaware limited liability company, and Craig

         Drill Capital L.P. (the "Partnership"), a Delaware

         limited partnership.  Mr. Drill is the managing

         member of the L.L.C., which is general partner of

         the Partnership.  The address for Mr. Drill, the

         L.L.C. and the Partnership is 767 Fifth Avenue, New

         York New York 10153.

         The principal business of Mr. Drill and the L.L.C.

         is to act as private investment managers.  The

         Partnership is a private investment partnership

         formed to trade and invest primarily in securities

         and financial instruments.

         Neither Mr. Drill, the L.L.C. nor the Partnership

         has, during the last five years, been convicted in

         a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations




                             8





<PAGE>


         or similar misdemeanors).  Neither Mr. Drill, the

         L.L.C. nor the Partnership has, during the last

         five years, been a party to a civil proceeding of a

         judicial or administrative body of competent

         jurisdiction which resulted in a judgment, decree

         or final order enjoining future violations of, or

         prohibiting or mandating activities subject to

         federal or state securities laws of finding any

         violation with respect to such laws.  

         Mr. Drill is a citizen of the United States of

         America.



Item 3.  Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration

         As of the date hereof, Mr. Drill, the L.L.C. and

         the Partnership are deemed to beneficially own

         922,000 shares of common stock (the "Common

         Shares").  The Common Shares were purchased in open

         market transactions at an aggregate cost of

         $7,810,375.14.  

         The funds for the purchase of the Common Shares

         were obtained from the working capital of the

         Partnership which, in the normal course of its

         business, was comprised of the Partnership's equity

         contributed by the limited partners and the general




                             9





<PAGE>


         partner, and earnings from the Partnership's

         operations.  No leverage was used to purchase the

         Common Shares.



Item 4.  Purpose of Transaction

         The Common Shares deemed to be beneficially owned

         by Mr. Drill, the L.L.C. and the Partnership were

         acquired for and are being held for investment

         purposes.  Neither of Mr. Drill, the L.L.C. nor the

         Partnership has any plan or proposal which relates

         to, or would result in, any of the actions

         enumerated in Item 4 of the Instructions to

         Schedule 13D.



Item 5.  Interest in Securities of the Issuer

         As of the date hereof, Mr. Drill, the L.L.C. and

         the Partnership are deemed to be the beneficial

         owners of 922,000 Common Shares.  Based on AGI's

         most recently filed Form 10K, there are believed to

         be 16,889,781 Common Shares of AGI outstanding.

         Therefore, Mr. Drill, the L.L.C. and the

         Partnership are deemed to beneficially own 5.46% of

         the outstanding Common Shares.  Each of Mr. Drill,

         the L.L.C. and the Partnership share the power to




                            10





<PAGE>


         vote, direct the vote, dispose of or direct the

         disposition of all Common Shares of which they are

         deemed to beneficially own.

         the Common Shares over the past 60 days appears

Item 6.  Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings of
         Relationships With Respect to Securities of
         the Issuer

         has any contracts, arrangements, understandings or

         relationships with any person with respect to the

         Common Shares.
