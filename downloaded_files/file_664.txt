PRELIMINARY NOTE


       The person filing this Amendment No. 2 is Tweedy, Browne Company L.P.
("TBC"), a Delaware limited partnership. This Amendment No. 2 amends a Statement
on Schedule 13D filed by TBC dated August 10, 1994 (the "Statement"). The
filing of this Amendment No. 2 should not be deemed an admission that TBC
comprises a group within the meaning of Section 13(d) (3) of the Securities and
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Act").

       This Amendment No. 2 relates to the Common Stock, $1.00 par value (the
"Common Stock"), of TCC Industries, Inc. (The "Company"), which, to the best
knowledge of the persons filing this Amendment No. 2, is a company organized
under the laws of Texas, with its principal executive offices at 816 Congress
Avenue, Suite 1250, Austin, Texas 78701.

       This Amendment No. 2 contains information regarding shares of Common
Stock that may be deemed to be beneficially owned by TBC. Such shares are held
in the accounts of various customers of TBC, with respect to which it has
obtained sole or shared voting power.

       Other than as set forth below, to the best knowledge of TBC there has
been no material change in the information set forth in response to Items
1,2,3,4,6 and 7 of the Statement, as amended. Accordingly, those Items are
omitted from this Amendment No. 2.



ITEM 5.  INTEREST IN SECURITIES OF THE ISSUER

       (a)    As of the date hereof, TBC may be deemed to be the beneficial
owner of an aggregate of 148,774 shares of Common Stock, which constitutes
approximately 5.39% of the 2,762,000 shares of Common Stock which TBC believes
to be the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. The TBC Shares are
held in the TBC Accounts.

       TBC disclaims that it is the beneficial owner of any of the shares of
Common Stock held in the TBC Accounts. The aggregate number of shares of Common
Stock with respect to which TBC could be deemed to be the beneficial owner as of
the date hereof, is 148,774 shares, which constitutes approximately 5.39% of the
2,762,000 shares of Common Stock, which the filing person believes to be the
total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding, but nothing contained herein
shall be construed as an admission that TBC is the beneficial owner of any of
the TBC Shares.

       The aggregate number of shares and percentage of Common Stock with
respect to which each of the General Partners may be deemed to be the beneficial
owner by reason of his being a general partner of TBC is 148,774 shares, which
constitutes approximately 5.39% of the 2,762,000 shares of Common Stock
outstanding. However, nothing contained herein shall be construed as an
admission that any of the General Partners is the beneficial owner of any shares
of Common Stock, except as set forth herein as expressly and admittedly being
beneficially owned by a particular General Partner.

       TBC disclaims beneficial ownership of Common Stock held by the other.
Except as described herein, to the best knowledge of TBC no person who may be
deemed to comprise a group with any of TBC or any other person named in Item 2
of the Statement, beneficially owns any shares of Common Stock.

       (b)    TBC has investment discretion with respect to 148,774 shares of
Common Stock held by the TBC Accounts and has sole power to dispose or direct
the disposition of all of such shares. Of these shares of Common Stock, TBC has
sole power to vote or to direct the voting of 138,900 shares of Common Stock
held in certain TBC Accounts.







<PAGE>   5


       Each of the General Partners of TBC, solely by reason of their positions
as such, may be deemed to have (i) shared power to dispose of or to direct the
disposition of all of the shares of Common Stock held in the TBC Accounts; and
(ii) shared power to vote or direct the vote of 138,900 shares of Common Stock
held in certain TBC Accounts.

       (c)    During the sixty-day period ended as of the date hereof, TBC sold
shares of Common Stock in open market transactions, as follows:

account with TBC has the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of
dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of, the shares of Common Stock
held in said person's TBC Account.
