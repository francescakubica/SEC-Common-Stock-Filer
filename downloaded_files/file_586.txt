American General Corporation ("American General") and AGC Life Insurance
Company ("AGC Life") hereby amend their statement on Schedule 13D, as
amended by Amendment No. 1 and Amendment No. 2  thereto (the
"Statement"), relating to the common stock of Western National
Corporation ("Western") as follows:


Item 2.  Identity and Background.

(a)-(c)     An updated list of the executive officers and directors of
            American General is attached hereto as Exhibit 1 in response
            to Item 2(a)-(c).  An updated list of the executive officers
            and directors of AGC Life is attached hereto as Exhibit 2 in
            response to  Item 2(a)-(c).  


Item 3.  Source and Amount of Funds and Other Consideration.

  All of the 7,254,464 shares of Series A Participating Preferred
  Stock of Western (such 7,254,464 shares being hereinafter referred
  to as the "Preferred Shares") acquired by American General on
  September 30, 1996, were subsequently transferred to AGC Life.  On
  May 20, 1997, the Preferred Shares automatically converted into
  7,254,464 shares of Western's common stock (the "Underlying Common
  Shares") in accordance with the conversion terms of the Preferred
  Shares.  The conversion was triggered by the approval of the
  holders of Western's common stock at the issuer's annual meeting
  on May 20, 1997.


Item 4.  Purpose of Transaction. 

  The Underlying Common Shares were acquired for investment and not
  with the purpose nor with the effect of changing or influencing the
  control of Western, nor in connection with or as a participant in
  any transaction having such purpose or effect.


Item 5.  Interest in Securities of Issuer.

(a)    American General may be deemed to beneficially own, through its
       wholly owned subsidiary AGC Life, an aggregate of 32,201,964 shares
       or 46.2% of Western's issued and outstanding shares of common
       stock. 

  Robert M. Devlin, who serves as an executive officer and director
  of American General and as a director of AGC Life, has advised
  American General that he owns 10,000 shares or approximately .0002%
  of the issued and outstanding shares of Western's common stock. 
  The poll of the directors of AGC Life has not been completed and,
  if necessary, an amendment will be filed if any of such directors
  owns shares of Western's common stock.

(b)    American General and AGC Life may be deemed to have shared power
       to vote or to direct the vote and to dispose or direct the
       disposition of the 32,201,964 shares of Western's common stock held
       by AGC Life, subject to the terms of the amended Shareholder's
       Agreement (see Item 7, Exhibits 4 and 6). American General and AGC
       Life know of no other person who will have the power to vote or to
       direct the vote and to dispose or to direct the disposition of the
       securities reported herein.

  Mr. Devlin has advised American General that he has the sole power
  to vote or to direct the vote and to dispose or to direct the
  disposition of his shares reported in Item 5(a) above.

(c)    There have been no transactions in the securities reported herein
       during the past 60 days, other than the conversion of the Preferred
       Shares reported above in Item 3.

<PAGE>
Item 7.  Material to be filed as Exhibits.  The list of exhibits is

            General in response to Item 2(a)-(c).

  Exhibit 2 Executive Officer and Director List for AGC Life in
            response to Item 2(a)-(c).

  Exhibit 3 Stock Purchase Agreement dated December 2, 1994

            Holding Company in response to Item 5(a) (incorporated

            December 2, 1994 filed by American General).

  Exhibit 4 Shareholder's Agreement dated December 2, 1994 between

            (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 4 to Schedule
            13D dated December 2, 1994 filed by American General).

  Exhibit 5 Stock Purchase Agreement dated September 13, 1996
            between American General and Western in response to
