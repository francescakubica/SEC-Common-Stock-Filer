Virginia 22170.

ITEM 2.  Identity and Background.
         ------------------------

     This Amendment is filed by General Electric Company, a New York corporation
("GE").  GE is a New York  corporation  with  its  principal  executive  offices
located at 3135 Easton  Turnpike,  Fairfield,  Connecticut  06431. GE engages in
providing a wide variety of  industrial,  commercial  and consumer  products and
services.

ITEM 2(a), (b) and (c)

     For information with respect to the identity and background of
each director and executive officer of GE, see Schedule I attached hereto.

     This  Amendment  is being  filed  while GE is in the  process of  verifying
information  required  herein  from  their  respective  executive  officers  and
directors.  If GE  obtains  information  which  would  cause  a  change  in  the
information  contained  herein,  another  amendment  will be filed that will set
forth such change in information.

     1.   United States ex rel.  Taxpayers Against Fraud and Chester L. Walsh v.
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------
          General Electric Company.
          -------------------------

     On November  15,  1990,  an action  under the federal  False Claims Act, 31
U.S.C.  subscection  3729-32,  was filed  under seal  against  General  Electric
Company ("GE") in the United States District Court for the Southern  District of
Ohio. The qui tam action,  brought by an organization  called Taxpayers  Against
Fraud and an employee of GE's Aircraft Engines division  ("GEAE"),  alleged that
GEAE,  in  connection  with  its  sales of F110  aircraft  engines  and  support
equipment to Israel,  made false  statements to the Israeli  Ministry of Defense

<PAGE>


(MoD),  causingMoD  to submit false claims to the United  States  Department  of
Defense under the Foreign  Military Sales Program.  Senior GE management  became
aware of possible  misconduct in GEAE's  Israeli F110 program in December  1990.
Before  learning  of the sealed qui tam suit,  GE  immediately  made a voluntary
disclosure to the Departments of Defense and Justice,  promised full cooperation
and  restitution,  and began an  internal  investigation.  In August  1991,  the
federal court action was unsealed,  and the Department of Justice intervened and
took over responsibility for the case.

     On July 22,  1992,  after GE had  completed  its  investigation  and made a
complete  factual  disclosure  to the  U.S.  government  as part  of  settlement
discussions,  the United States and GE executed a settlement agreement and filed
a  stipulation  dismissing  the civil action.  Without  admitting or denying the
allegations in the complaint,  GE agreed to pay $59.5 million in full settlement
of the civil fraud claims.  Also on July 22, 1992,  in connection  with the same
matter,  the United  States  filed a four  count  information  charging  GE with
violations of 18 U.S.C.  section 287 (submitting false claims against the United
States), 18 U.S.C. section 1957 (engaging in monetary transactions in criminally
derived property), and 15 U.S.C. subsection 78m(b)(2)(A) and 78ff(a) (inaccurate
books and records),  and 18 U.S.C. section 371 (conspiracy to defraud the United
States and to commit offenses  against the United States).  The same day, GE and
the  United  States  entered  a plea  agreement  in  which  GE  agreed  to waive
indictment,  plead guilty to the information, and pay a fine of $9.5 million. GE
was  that  day  sentenced  by the  federal  court  in  accordance  with the plea
agreement.

     2.   Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution v. IGE Medical Systems Limited
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------
          (St. Albans  Magistrates Court, St. Albans,  Hertsfordshire,  England,
          Case No. 04/00320181)

     In April,  1994,  General Electric Medical  System's U.K.  subsidiary,  IGE
Medical  Systems  Limited  (IGEMS)  discovered the loss of a radioactive  barium
source at the Radlett,  England  facility.  The lost  source,  used to calibrate
nuclear camera detectors, emits a very low level of radiation. IGEMS immediately
reported the loss as required by the U.K. Radioactive Substances Act. An ensuing
investigation,  conducted in cooperation with government authorities,  failed to
locate the source.  On July 21, 1994,  Her Majesty's  Inspectorate  of Pollution
(HMIP) charged IGEMS with violating the Radioactive Substances Act by failing to
comply with a condition of registration. The Act provides that a registrant like
IGEMS,  which "does not comply with a limitation  or condition  subject to which
(it) is so registered ... shall be guilty of (a criminal)  offense." Condition 7
of IGEMS' registration states that it "shall so far as is reasonably practicable
prevent ... loss of any registered source."

     At the beginning of trial on February 24, 1995, IGEMS entered a guilty plea
and agreed to pay a fine of 5,000(Pounds)  and assessed costs of  5,754(Pounds).
The prosecutor's  presentation  focused primarily on the 1991 change in internal
ITEMS  procedures  and,  in  particular,   the  source  logging  procedure.  The
prosecutor  complimented  ITEMS'  investigation and efforts to locate the source
and advised the court that ITEMS had no previous  violations of the  Radioactive

<PAGE>


Substances  Act.  He also  told  the  court  that  the  Radlett  plant  had been
highlighted  as an  exemplary  facility  to HMIP  inspectors  as  part of  their
training.  In mitigation,  ITEMS emphasized the significant  infrastructure  and
expense  undertaken by ITEMS to provide  security for radiation  sources and the
significant  effort and  expense  incurred in  attempting  to locate the missing
source.

ITEM 2(f)

     All of the executive officers and directors of GE are U.S. citizens, except
that Paolo  Fresco,  an  executive  officer  and  director  of GE, is an Italian
citizen, and Claudio X. Gonzalez, a director of GE, is a citizen of Mexico.

ITEM 3.  Source and Amount of Funds and Other Consideration
         --------------------------------------------------

     Not applicable.

ITEM 4.  Purpose of Transaction
         ----------------------

     As of August 16, 1996,  GE entered into three written  agreements  with the
Company  which are  attached  as  exhibits  to this  Amendment  (Exhibits 1 to 3
attached  hereto).  The  agreements  relate  to the  Company's  Series  B Senior
Preferred  Stock,  $.01 par value ("Series B Preferred Stock" or "Series B") and
Series C Senior Preferred  Stock,  $.01 par value ("Series C Preferred Stock" or
"Series  C").  Prior to August 16,  1996,  there were 59,584  shares of Series B
Preferred Stock and 39,723 shares of Series C Preferred Stock  outstanding,  all
of which were owned by GE.

     Pursuant to a Stock  Purchase  Agreement  dated August 16, 1996 (the "Stock
Purchase  Agreement"),  GE sold 47,667  shares of Series B  Preferred  Stock and
31,778  shares of  Series C  Preferred  Stock to the  Company  for an  aggregate
purchase price of $2,400,000.  Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement,  GE (i)
waived any and all  breaches  by the  Company of any  covenants,  agreements  or
obligations that may have occurred under the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement,
dated  as of May 31,  1990  ("Preferred  Stock  Purchase  Agreement")  and  (ii)
surrendered any rights it had under the Preferred  Stock Purchase  Agreement and
the Certificate of Designation  for the Series B and Series C shares,  including
any claim with respect to the payment of any dividend on the shares repurchased.

     As of August 16, 1996, GE and the Company  entered into  Amendment No. 1 to
the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement ("Amendment No. 1") pursuant to which the
parties  eliminated  certain  rights of GE and covenants and  obligations of the
Company,  including,  among others, eliminating (i) the Company's obligations to
provide  certain  financial  statements  and other  reports to GE, (ii)  certain
inspection  rights of GE,  (iii)  certain  limits on the conduct of business and
amount of indebtedness, and (iv) certain limits on the ability of the Company to
issue capital  stock.  Pursuant to Amendment No. 1, the parties also  eliminated
the exclusive  right of Series B and Series C shareholders  to elect two members

<PAGE>


of the Company's  Board of Directors and also  eliminated the exclusive right of
Series B and Series C shareholders to elect a majority of the Board of Directors
of the Company upon the  occurrence of certain  breaches of the Preferred  Stock
Purchase Agreement.

     Additionally,  the Company and GE entered  into a Stock  Option  Agreement,
dated August 16, 1996  ("Stock  Option  Agreement"),  under which GE granted the
Company an irrevocable option (the "Option") to purchase GE's remaining Series B
and Series C shares, consisting of 11,917 shares of Series B and 7,945 shares of
Series C (including all rights to any accrued and unpaid dividends), at any time
between August 16, 1996 and August 16, 1999, for an aggregate  purchase price of
$600,000.  Under the Stock Option  Agreement,  GE has agreed not to convert into
Common  Stock the Series B or Series C shares which are subject to the Option or
to grant any other rights to any person to buy or acquire any of its Series B or
Series C shares during the term of the Option.

     Under the Company's  Restated  Certificate of Incorporation,  as amended in
connection with the three above-referenced agreements entered into on August 16,
1996,  each of the  Series B and  Series C shares  owned by GE,  subject  to the
Option,  is convertible into 100 shares of Common Stock at a conversion price of
$1.00 per share of Common Stock, subject to certain adjustment provisions,  and,
except as  otherwise  required by law,  each Series B and Series C share has the
right to one vote for each share of Common  Stock into which such share could be
converted,  voting together with the holders of Common Stock with respect to any
matter  upon  which  holders of Common  Stock have the right to vote.  (As noted
above,  such amended voting rights  eliminated the exclusive class voting rights
of the Series B and Series C shares to elect two directors of the Company,  or a
majority of the Board of Directors under certain  circumstances.)  As also noted
above,  under the Stock  Option  Agreement,  during the term of the  Option,  GE
agreed not to convert its Series B and Series C shares  into Common  Stock or to
grant any other  rights to any person to buy or  otherwise  acquire  any of such
shares.

     The above  transactions  were consummated in connection with the resolution
of an arbitration  claim by the Company  against GE. In August 1996, GE paid the
Company $9.4 million, the amount, including interest,  awarded to the Company in
March 1996 on its claim  against GE. The payment from GE arose from a demand for
arbitration  that the  Company  filed  against GE in January  1995.  Following a
hearing  on  the  Company's  demand,  a  three-member   panel  of  the  American
Arbitration Association found in favor of the Company.

     GE paid the award in connection with the Stock Purchase Agreement, pursuant
to which the  Company  repurchased  80% of the  Company's  Series B and Series C
Preferred  Stock held by GE. The Company  paid GE $2.4 million for such Series B
and Series C shares which had an aggregate  redemption  price of $13.0  million,
including  100% of  cumulative,  undeclared  dividends that totaled in excess of
$5.0  million.  In the Stock  Option  Agreement,  GE  granted  to the  Company a

<PAGE>


three-year  option to repurchase  the remaining 20% of the Series B and Series C
Preferred  Stock at the same per share price that the Company paid in the August
1996 repurchase.

     The remaining  Series B and Series C shares accrue dividends at the rate of
10% per annum from  August 16, 1996  (subject  to the terms of the Stock  Option
Agreement).

     Except as set forth above,  GE has no plans or proposals which relate to or
would result in the types of transactions set forth in subparagraphs (a) through
(j) of Item 4.

ITEM 5.  Interest in Securities of the Issuer
         ------------------------------------

     (a) GE continues to beneficially  own the 624,339 shares of Common Stock of
the  Company  which it owned  prior  to  August  16,  1996.  As a result  of the
transactions described above in Item 4, GE disclaims beneficial ownership of the
aggregate of 1,986,200 shares of Common Stock into which GE's remaining Series B
and Series C shares are  convertible  under the terms of the Company's  Restated
Certificate of Incorporation,  as amended,  since,  under the terms of the Stock
Option Agreement, GE has agreed that it will not effect such a conversion during
the term of the Option. The 624,339 shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by
GE constitute  3.1% of the 19,841,924  shares of Common Stock  outstanding as of
December 31, 1996 as reported in the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for
the  quarter  ended  December  31,  1996.  Neither  GE,  nor, to the best of its
knowledge,  any of its executive  officers or directors,  beneficially  owns any
other  securities  of the  Company  or have a right to  acquire  any  additional
securities of the Company.

     (b) GE has sole voting  power and sole  dispositive  power over the 624,339
shares of Common Stock  beneficially  owned by it. Except as described  above in
Item 4,  neither  GE, nor, to the best of its  knowledge,  any of its  executive
officers or directors, has the power to vote or to direct the vote or to dispose
or direct the disposition of any other  securities of the Company.  As described
in Item 4 above, under the Stock Option Agreement,  GE has agreed not to convert
the Series B or Series C shares into Common Stock during the term of the Option.

     (c) Except as disclosed in this Amendment,  neither GE, nor, to the best of
its  knowledge,  any of its executive  officers or  directors,  has effected any
transaction in securities of the Company during the past 60 days.

     (d) No person  except  for GE is known to have the right to  receive or the
power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of,
securities covered by this Amendment, except that, as described in Item 4 above,
GE has entered into the Stock Option  Agreement  whereby the Company can acquire
GE's remaining Series B and Series C shares, including the rights to any accrued
and unpaid dividends, whether or not declared.

<PAGE>


     (e)  For the  reasons  indicated  in this  Amendment,  as a  result  of the
agreements  and  transactions  described  above in Item 4, GE  ceased  to be the
beneficial owner of more than 5% of the Common Stock on August 16, 1996.

ITEM 6.  Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships with Respect 
         --------------------------------------------------------------------- 
         to Securities of the Issuer
         ---------------------------
