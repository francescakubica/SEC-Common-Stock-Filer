             Common Stock, $0.01 par value ("Class B Common Stock") of
             Smith s Food & Drug Centers, Inc. (the "Issuer"). The
             principal executive office and mailing address of the Issuer
             is 1550 South Redwood Road, Salt Lake City, Utah 84104.

             Item 2.   Identity and Background

                       This Statement is filed by Transamerica Corporation
             ("Transamerica"), a Delaware corporation. Its address is 600
             Montgomery Street, San Francisco, California 94111. See
             Annex A for the identities of and certain information
             relating to Transamerica's directors and executive officers.

                       Neither Transamerica nor any of its directors or
             executive officers has, during the past five years, been
             convicted of any criminal proceeding (other than a traffic
             citation or similar, minor infraction), nor been a party to a
             civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of
             competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was
             or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining
             future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities
             subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any
             violation with respect to such laws. Each of the persons
             named in Annex A is a citizen of the United States of
             America, except Richard H. Finn, who is a citizen of Great
             Britain.

             Item 3.   Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration

                       The source of funds for purchases of Class B Common
             Stock reported as beneficially owned in Item 5 of this
             Statement was the working capital of Transamerica and its
             subsidiaries. The shares owned for the benefit of investment
             advisory clients of one of Transamerica's subsidiaries were
             purchased with cash assets of such clients.

             Item 4.   Purpose of Transaction

                       The shares of Class B Common Stock beneficially
             owned by Transamerica and its subsidiaries were acquired in
             the ordinary course of business for investment purposes and
             were not acquired for the purpose (and do not have the
             effect) of changing or influencing the control of the Issuer,
             and were not acquired in connection with any transaction
             having such purposes or effects. Depending on market
             conditions and other factors, Transamerica or its
             subsidiaries may purchase additional shares of Class B Common
             Stock in the open market or in private transactions.
             Alternatively, depending on market conditions and other
             factors, Transamerica and its subsidiaries may, at some
             future time, sell all or some of their shares of Class B


                                          -4-<PAGE>





             Common Stock.

                       Neither Transamerica nor any of its directors or
             officers has plans or proposals that relate to or would
             result in any of the actions set forth in clauses (a) through
             (j) of Item 4.

             Item 5.   Interest in Securities of the Issuer

                       (a), (b), (c) and (d) As of August 5, 1996,
             Transamerica directly owned, and had sole voting and
             dispositive power with respect to, 467,900 shares of Class B
             Common Stock. According to information supplied by the
             Issuer, the number of shares of Class B Common Stock
             outstanding as of June 20, 1996 was 10,312,630. Based on such
             information, the 467,900 shares of Class B Common Stock
             directly owned by Transamerica represent approximately 4.54%
             of the class. See Annex B with respect to transactions by
             Transamerica in Class B Common Stock, all of which were
             effected through broker-dealers.

                       In addition, certain subsidiaries of Transamerica
             that are eligible to file Schedule 13G pursuant to Rule 13d-1
             may be deemed to beneficially own an additional 1,045,534
             shares (including 998,201 shares owned for the benefit of
             investment advisory clients of one of Transamerica s
             subsidiaries) of Class B Common Stock. Such shares represent
             an additional 10.14% of the class.

                       Note: Management of the affairs of Transamerica s
             subsidiaries, including decisions respecting dispositions
             and/or voting of the shares of the Class B Common Stock
             beneficially owned by such subsidiaries, resides in the
             respective officers and directors of the subsidiaries and is
             not directed by Transamerica or other subsidiaries.
             Accordingly, the filing of this Schedule 13D by Transamerica
             is not intended as, and should not be deemed as, an
             acknowledgment of beneficial ownership or shared voting or
             dispositive power by Transamerica of the shares of the Class
             B Common Stock beneficially owned by its subsidiaries, and
             such beneficial ownership or attribution or shared voting or
             dispositive power is expressly disclaimed.

                       (e)  Not applicable.

             Item 6.   Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or
             Relationships with Respect to Securities of the Issuer

                       None.

             Item 7.   Material to be Filed as Exhibits

                       None.
