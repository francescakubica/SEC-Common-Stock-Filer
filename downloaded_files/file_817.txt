PRELIMINARY NOTE

         This Amendment No. 4 is being filed because the filing persons are no

ITEM 3.  SOURCE AND AMOUNTS OF FUNDS OR OTHER CONSIDERATION

         As of the date hereof, TBC does not beneficially own any shares of
Common Stock ("the TBC Shares").

         The TBC Shares are held in the TBC Accounts, the funds therefor coming
from the funds on hand in each individual managed account and in certain
instances from standard margin account borrowings from brokerage accounts
maintained at Fleet Clearing Corporation. It is expected that funds used by the
TBC Accounts to purchase additional shares of Common Stock, if additional shares
are purchased by the TBC Accounts (see Item 4 hereof), will come from the funds
on hand for each individual managed account, which funds on hand at any time and
from time to time may include, among others, funds borrowed pursuant to margin
accounts maintained at Fleet Clearing Corporation. Borrowings made by certain
TBC Accounts pursuant to such margin accounts are secured by margin securities
owned by the respective accounts, including some of the TBC Shares. Interest on
outstanding borrowings under such margin accounts ranges from 1/2% to 2% over
the brokers' call rate in effect from time to time at Chemical Bank, New York,
New York, depending upon the amount of outstanding borrowings at any given time.

         As of the date hereof, TBK does not beneficially own any shares of
 Common Stock (the "TBK Shares").

         It is expected that funds used by TBK to purchase additional shares of
Common Stock, if additional shares are purchased by TBK (see Item 4 hereof),
will come from TBK's general funds, which include cash and cash equivalents on
hand and in banks.

         TBK's general funds have included, and it is expected that they will
from time to time include, funds borrowed by it pursuant to an understanding
with Chemical Bank. As of the date hereof, TBK has a loan outstanding with
Chemical Bank in the amount of $20,000.00. Borrowings made by TBK pursuant to
that understanding bear interest at the brokers' call rate in effect from time
to time at Chemical Bank. TBK's funds on hand have also included, and it is
expected that they will from time to time include, funds borrowed by it pursuant
to an understanding with The Bank of New York, New York, New York. Pursuant to
that understanding, TBK may borrow funds at the brokers' call rate charged from
time to time by The Bank of New York. As of the date hereof, TBK has a loan
outstanding with The Bank of New York in the amount of $10,000.00. Borrowings
made by TBK pursuant to its understandings with Chemical Bank and The Bank of
New York are secured by securities owned by TBK; such borrowings are not secured
by any TBK Shares. No borrowings from Chemical Bank or The Bank of New York were
made for the purpose of acquiring the TBK Shares. TBK reserves the right to
include all or any of the shares of Common Stock owned by it at any time or from
time to time, among the securities that serve as collateral for such borrowings,
subject to compliance with any applicable statutes and regulations.
<PAGE>   7
ITEM 4.  PURPOSE OF TRANSACTION

         Each of TBC and TBK has acquired the shares of Common Stock owned by it
for investment purposes and for none of the reasons enumerated in Item 4 of
Schedule 13D, except that TBC and TBK may dispose of all or some of the TBC
Shares and the TBK Shares respectively, or may acquire additional shares of
Common Stock from time to time, depending upon price and market conditions,
evaluation of alternative investments, and other factors.

ITEM 5.  INTEREST IN SECURITIES OF THE ISSUER

         (a) As of the date hereof TBC does not beneficially own any shares of
Common Stock.

         As of the date hereof, TBK does not beneficially own any shares of

the shares of Common Stock held in the TBC Accounts.

         Each of TBC and TBK disclaims beneficial ownership of Common Stock held
by the other. Except as described herein, to the best knowledge of TBC and TBK,
no person may be deemed to comprise a group with any of TBC or TBK or any other
person named in Item 2 of the Statement, as amended, beneficially owns any
shares of Common Stock.

         (b)      Not applicable.

dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of, the shares of Common Stock
held in said person's TBC Account.

         To the best knowledge of TBK, no person other than TBK has the right to
receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds
from the sale of, the TBK Shares, except that the General Partners and Thomas P.
Knapp may be deemed to have such rights and powers solely by reason of being
general partners in TBK.

         AGREEMENT dated as of September 27, 1996 between Tweedy, Browne Company
L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ("TBC") and TBK Partners, L.P., a Delaware

                                   WITNESSETH:

         WHEREAS, in accordance with Rule 13d-1(f) of the Act, only one such
Statement need be filed whenever two or more persons are required to file such a
Statement pursuant to Section 13(d) of the Act with respect to the same
securities, provided that said persons agree in writing that such Statement is
filed on behalf of each of them.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual agreements
herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:

         TBC and TBK do hereby agree, in accordance with Rule 13d-1(f) under the
Act, to file one Statement on Schedule 13D relating to their ownership of the
