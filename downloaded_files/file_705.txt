                                  SCHEDULE 13D

         This Amendment No. 1 reflects open market sales of 1,150,000 ordinary
shares, 10p each ("Ordinary Shares"), of Xenova Group PLC ("Xenova") by Biotech
Target S.A., a Panamanian corporation ("Biotech Target") and wholly owned
subsidiary of BB Biotech AG, a Swiss corporation ("BB Biotech") during the
period of March 6, 1997 through April 15, 1997. As of March 19, 1997, Biotech
Target and BB Biotech ceased to have beneficial ownership of more than 5
percent of the outstanding ordinary shares of Xenova.

ITEM 5.  INTEREST IN SECURITIES OF THE ISSUER

         ITEMS 5(a), (b), (c) AND (e) ARE AMENDED IN THEIR ENTIRETY TO READ AS
FOLLOWS:

         (a)      As of October 26, 1995, Biotech Target held 1,000,000 shares,
or approximately 8.8 percent, of Xenova's outstanding ordinary shares. Since
that time, Biotech Target has sold shares in the open market to reduce its
holdings to 100,000 shares, or approximately 0.79 percent of the outstanding
ordinary shares of Xenova, as reported in Xenova's Form 20-F for the period
ending December 31, 1995. As a result of its ownership of Biotech Target, BB
Biotech may be deemed to be the indirect beneficial owner of the Xenova
ordinary shares held directly in the aggregate by Biotech Target as of April
11, 1997, which represents approximately 0.79 percent of the outstanding Xenova
ordinary shares. No Xenova ordinary shares are directly owned by BB Biotech. To
the best knowledge of BB Biotech and Biotech Target, no director or executive
officer of BB Biotech or Biotech Target owns any Xenova ordinary shares.

         (b)      The number of ordinary shares of Xenova to which there is
sole power to vote or to direct the vote, shared power to vote or to direct the
vote, sole power to dispose or to direct the disposition, or shared power to
dispose or direct the disposition is set forth in the cover pages and such
information is incorporated herein by reference. BB Biotech, through its
ownership of Biotech Target, may be deemed to beneficially own the ordinary
shares of Xenova within the meaning of Regulation 13D under the Exchange Act,
and may be deemed to share with Biotech Target the power to vote or direct the
vote of and the power to dispose of or direct the disposition of the aggregate
100,000 ordinary shares of Xenova directly held by Biotech Target. BB Biotech
hereby expressly declares that the filing of this statement shall not be
construed as an admission that it is, for purposes of Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act, the beneficial owner of the Xenova ordinary shares held by
Biotech Target.

         (c)      A summary of transactions in Xenova ordinary shares
effected by Biotech Target during the past sixty days is attached

                               Page 4 of 5 Pages

hereto as Exhibit A and such information is incorporated herein by reference.

         (e)      As of March 19, 1997, BB Biotech and Biotech Target ceased to
have beneficial ownership of more than 5 percent of Xenova's outstanding
ordinary shares.

                                   SIGNATURES

         After reasonable inquiry and to the best of my knowledge and belief, I
certify that the information set forth in this statement is true, complete and
correct.
