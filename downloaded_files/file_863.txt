ITEM 2.   IDENTITY AND BACKGROUND

          This statement on Schedule 13D is being filed by Deutsche Bank AG
("DBAG"), Morgan Grenfell Asset Management Limited ("MGAM") and Morgan

          During the last five years, none of the Reporting Persons and, to

Schedule A hereto has been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding
traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or has been a party to a civil

(c) a sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of Natuzzi or any of its
subsidiaries; (d) any change in the present board of directors or management
of Natuzzi, including any plans or proposals to change the number or term of
directors or to fill any existing vacancies on the board; (e) any material
change in the present capitalization or dividend policy of Natuzzi; (f) any
other material change in Natuzzi's business or corporate structure; (g)
changes in Natuzzi's charter, by-laws or instruments corresponding thereto, or
other actions which may impede the acquisition of the control of Natuzzi by
any person; (h) any of Natuzzi's securities being delisted from a national
securities exchange or ceasing to be authorized to be quoted in an inter-
dealer quotation system of a registered national securities association; (i)
any of Natuzzi's equity securities becoming eligible for termination of
registration pursuant to Section 12(g)(4) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended; or (j) any action similar to any of those enumerated above.

          Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Reporting Persons, acting
directly and, in the case of DBAG and MGAM, indirectly through the MGAM
