                                  SCHEDULE 13D

                                  Statement of
                      Reporting Persons (as defined below)

                        Pursuant to Section 13(d) of the
                         Securities Exchange Act of 1934

                                  in respect of

                                 IMMUNOGEN, INC.


                  This Report filed by Capital Ventures International ("CVI") is
the third amendment of its initial filing on Schedule 13D with respect to the
common stock, $.01 par value per share (the "Common Stock"), of Immunogen, Inc.
(the "Company").

                  This Report relates to sales by CVI of an aggregate of 712,045
shares of Common Stock. Such sales took place in open market transactions
between April 18, 1997 and June 17, 1997 at per share prices (net of brokerage
commissions) of between $1.2925 and $1.6789. The percentage of shares of Common
Stock reported as beneficially owned by CVI in this Report has remained at 9.9%
because the Preferred Shares and Warrants (each, as defined below) held by CVI
provide that the holder thereof may never convert the Preferred Shares or
exercise the Warrants to the extent that upon such conversion or exercise such
holder would hold in excess of 9.9% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock.
Although the percentage of Common Stock which CVI beneficially owns has not
changed, CVI is voluntarily filing this Report to disclose its activity in the
Common Stock in the event that such activity is nevertheless deemed to be
material.

                  The descriptions contained in this Report of certain
agreements and documents are qualified in their entirety by reference to the
completed text of such agreements and documents filed as Exhibits to this filing
and the prior filings of this Schedule 13D.

                  Items 3, 4, 5 and 7 are hereby amended and restated in their
entirety as follows:

Item 3.           Source and Amount of Funds and Other Consideration.

                  CVI is a party to a Securities Purchase Agreement with the
Company, dated as of March 15, 1996, pursuant to which CVI agreed to acquire for
purposes of investment convertible debentures in the aggregate principal amount
of $5,000,000 (the "Debentures"). Pursuant to the terms of the Securities
Purchase Agreement, two Debentures, each in an aggregate principal amount of
$2,500,000 (the "First Debenture" and the "Second Debenture", respectively) were
issued and sold to CVI in separate closings. The aggregate purchase price for
the Debentures was $5,000,000. The first closing occurred as of March 25, 1996.
The second closing occurred as of June 13, 1996.

                  The First Debenture was converted into Common Stock, First
Debenture Warrants (as defined below) and June Amendment Warrants (as defined
below) on June 6, 1996 and is no longer outstanding. The Second Debenture was
converted, in accordance with the terms of a Letter Agreement, dated as of
September 30, 1996, by and between the Company and CVI (the "September Letter
Agreement"),

                                                                       ---

into 2,500 shares of Series A Preferred Stock of the Company, $.01 par value per
share (the "Preferred Shares").


                  Each outstanding Preferred Share, together with dividends
accrued thereon (at a rate of 9% per annum), is convertible into that number of
shares of Common Stock as equals the $1,000 stated value of each Preferred Share
plus accrued dividends thereon divided by a price per share (the "Conversion
Price") equal to the lesser of: (i) $2.50 (the "Fixed Conversion Price") and
(ii) 85% of the average of the closing bid prices for the Common Stock on the
NASDAQ National Market , or on the principal securities exchange or other
securities market on which the Common Stock is then being traded, for the five
consecutive trading days ending one trading day prior to the conversion date
(subject to equitable adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends,
combinations, recapitalization, reclassifications of similar events).

                  The holder of the Preferred Shares has the right to convert,
at any time or from time to time, all or any of the Preferred Shares into (i)
Common Stock at the Conversion Price and (ii) warrants (the "Preferred Share
Warrants") to acquire a number of shares of Common Stock equal to 50% of the
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion. The Warrants (as
defined below) expire five years from the date of issuance and are exercisable
at a price of $4.00 per share.

                  Simultaneously, with the execution of the Securities Purchase
Agreement, the Company and CVI entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, as
amended, pursuant to which the Company agreed to register the resale by CVI of
the Common Stock underlying the Debentures, the Preferred Shares and the
Warrants under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act").

                  CVI utilized its own funds to consummate the purchase of the
Debentures.

Item 4.           Purpose of Transaction.

                  CVI acquired the Debentures and Preferred Shares for
investment purposes for its own account. CVI does not currently have any plan or
intention to acquire additional securities of the Company other than its
intention to acquire the shares of Common Stock and Preferrred Share Warrants
issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Shares and the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of the Warrants.

                  Except as stated above, CVI has no plans or proposals that
relate or would result in any of the transactions referred to in sub-items (a)
through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D.

Item 5.           Interest in Securities of the Issuer.

                  On June 6, 1996, CVI converted the First Debenture into
1,018,000 shares of Common Stock and Warrants to acquire 509,000 shares of
Common Stock (the "First Debenture Warrants"). The conversion was effected at
the request of the Company pursuant to an Amendment Agreement dated June 6, 1996
(the "June Amendment"). In consideration for agreeing to the June Amendment, CVI
was granted warrants to purchase an additional 500,000 shares of Common Stock
(the "June Amendment Warrants" and, together with the Preferred Shares Warrants
and the First Debenture Warrants, the "Warrants").

                  Between July 2 and August 20, CVI sold in open market
transactions an aggregate of 859,500 shares of Common Stock at per share prices
(net of brokerage commissions) of between $3.25 and $5.75. Such sales of Common
Stock resulted in the receipt by CVI of aggregate net proceeds of approximately
$3,826,061.

                  On September 30, 1996, pursuant to the September Letter
Agreement, CVI converted the Second Debenture into 2,500 Preferred Shares.

market transactions an aggregate of 538,100 shares of Common Stock at per share
prices (net of brokerage commissions) of between $3.96 and $1.48. Such sales of

open market transaction 400 shares of Common Stock at a per share price (net of

                  During the period from April 14, 1997 to June 11, 1997, CVI

thereon) into 1,328,744 shares of Common Stock at Conversion Prices between
$1.06 and $1.31 per share. In addition, CVI purchased, in an open market

                  Pursuant to the terms of the Company's Restated Articles of
Organization and the Warrants, the holder thereof may never convert Preferred
Shares or exercise such Warrants to the extent that upon such conversion or
exercise such holder would hold in excess of 9.9% of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock. In addition, the disposition of the Preferred Shares and the
Warrants is restricted so that, except in limited circumstances, the holder may
not dispose of during any 90 day period an amount of Preferred Shares and
Warrants which, if converted into or exercised for Common Stock, would
represent, at the time of the transfer, in the aggregate (together with any
other Common Stock transferred), beneficial ownership by the transferee(s) of
more than 9.9% of the Common Stock then outstanding. As a result, CVI's
beneficial ownership of shares of Common Stock solely as a result of ownership
of the Preferred Shares and Warrants may never exceed 9.9% of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock. Based on the 20,723,565 shares of Common Stock
outstanding on June 6, 1997, the 9.9% limitation restricts CVI's ownership to
2,277,061 shares of Common Stock. CVI currently holds 256,599 shares of Common
Stock. Therefore, the maximum number of shares into which CVI could convert the
Preferred Shares and exercise the Warrants is 2,020,462.

                  The number of shares of Common Stock issuable to CVI upon
conversion of the Preferred Shares and exercise of the Warrants will fluctuate
depending on the Conversion Price from time to time in effect; provided,
however, except to the extent that shares are disposed of, the number of shares
so issuable will never be less than the number of shares issuable based on the
Fixed Conversion Price, but the aggregate

number of shares so issuable can never exceed 9.9% of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock (together with any other shares of Common Stock then owned by CVI).
To the extent the Conversion Price is less than the Fixed Conversion Price, the
aggregate number of shares issuable to CVI upon conversion of the Preferred
Shares and exercise of the Warrants will increase without any action on the part
of CVI, but the number of shares so issuable can never exceed 9.9% of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock (together with any other shares of Common
Stock then owned by CVI). The number of shares of Common Stock issuable to CVI
upon conversion of the Preferred Shares and exercise of the Preferred Share
Warrants can be determined by dividing the aggregate stated value of such
Preferred Shares plus accrued interest thereon by the Conversion Price then in
effect.

                  To the best knowledge of CVI, none of the individuals listed
in Item 2 hereof beneficially owns any Common Stock other than through their
ownership interest in CVI. Neither CVI, nor to the best of CVI's knowledge, any
of the individuals listed in Item 2 hereof has effected any transactions in the
Common Stock during the past 60 days other than CVI's sale of an aggregate of
710,045 shares of Common Stock as described herein.
