laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws.

Item 3.  Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.
         -------------------------------------------------

On May 10, 1995, CNA consummated the merger (the "Merger") of its wholly
owned subsidiary, Chicago Acquisition Corp. ("Merger Sub"), with and into
Continental, pursuant to the Merger Agreement dated as of December 6, 1994,
by and among CNA, Continental and Merger Sub, for aggregate consideration of
$1.125 million (based on a conversion price of $20.00 per share of
Continental's common stock, par value $1.00 per share).  CNA funded the cash
purchase price with proceeds from a five-year revolving credit facility from
a syndicate of banks led by The First National Bank of Chicago, as
administrative agent, and The Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., as syndication
agent.  As a result of and upon the consummation of the Merger, Continental
became a wholly owned subsidiary of CNA. CNA, therefore, may be deemed to
have become the beneficial owner of the Shares beneficially owned by
Continental as of the consumation of the Merger on May 10, 1995. Previously,
Continental and a subsidiary filed a Schedule 13D dated April 4, 1990 with
respect to the Shares.  The subject Schedule 13D supersedes such filing.  

On March 30, 1990, Continental acquired beneficial ownership of more than 5%
of the Shares (as calculated in the manner set forth in Regulation 13D-G)
when it purchased an aggregate of 595,031 shares of the Issuer's 8%
Cumulative, Convertible, Redeemable Preferred Shares, Series C (the "Series C
Preferred Stock").  The Series C Preferred Stock (after giving effect on
December 31, 1990 to a 1 for 5 split) is convertible into 2,975,155 Shares. 
As of March 30, 1990, Continental also owned 1,250,000 shares of the Issuer's
12% Cumulative, Convertible, Preferred Shares, Series A (the "Series A 
Preferred Stock)(which were convertible into Shares through February 28, 1995)
and 183,486 Shares (after giving effect to a 1 for 5 split on December 31, 
1990). On September 1, 1994, Continental transferred both the Series A 
Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock to its subsidiary Firemen's.  
On December 31, 1990, Continental transferred 183,486 Shares to its subsidiary
National-Ben.  

Item 4.  Purpose of Transaction.
         ----------------------

The Shares were, and are, included in the investment portfolio of Firemen's
and National-Ben.  
<PAGE>
<PAGE>
Except as otherwise stated in this Item 4, neither Loews, CNA, Continental,
Firemen's nor National-Ben has any plans or proposals with respect to the
Issuer that relate or that could result in any of the transactions specified
in clauses (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D, although CNA,
Continental, Firemen's and National-Ben (jointly, the "Insurance Companies")
expect that each of them will review their respective positions from time to
time and may make changes.  In addition, the Insurance Companies expect that 
each of them will from time to time review their respective investment
positions in the Issuer and may, depending upon market conditions or other
factors existing at the time of such review, increase or decrease their
respective positions.  In this connection, the Insurance Companies have
recently given active consideration to disposing of some or all of the
183,486 Shares held directly by National-Ben.
<PAGE>
<PAGE>
From time to time, executives in CNA's investment portfolio operation have
had discussions with senior executives of the Issuer.  Among other things
such individuals have discussed with the Issuer, the Issuer's financial
structure and working capital needs including the reinstatement of the
convertibility feature of the Series A Preferred Stock.  No agreement has
been reached.  See Exhibit 3. In addition, they have discussed with
the Issuer the possibility of a representative of the Insurance Companies
being elected to the Board of Directors of the Issuer.  Although the Issuer
has indicated its willingness to elect a representative of the Insurance
Companies to its Board of Directors, the Insurance Companies have not
determined to make such a request. The Insurance Companies expect, however,
that they may in the future request the Issuer to elect a representative of
the Insurance Companies to the Issuer's Board of Directors.

Item 5.  Interest in Securities of the Issuer.
         ------------------------------------

(a)(i) National-Ben is the beneficial owner of 183,486 Shares, representing
approximately 2.0% of the total number of Shares outstanding, as calculated
in the manner set forth in Regulation 13D-G.*

(ii)  Firemen's beneficially owns 595,031 shares of the Series C Preferred
Stock, which are convertible into 2,975,155 Shares.  Assuming conversion of
all of the Series C Preferred Stock, Firemen's beneficially would own 24.0%
of the total number of Shares outstanding, as calculated in the manner set
forth in Regulation 13D-G.*

(iii) Continental owns 100% of the outstanding common stock of both National-
Ben and Firemen's, and therefore, may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of
the 3,158,641 Shares beneficially owned by National-Ben and Firemen's, or
25.5% of the total number of Shares outstanding, as calculated in the manner
set forth in Regulation 13D-G.*

(iv)  CNA owns 100% of the outstanding common stock of Continental and
therefore, may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of the 3,158,641 Shares
beneficially owned by Continental, or 25.5% of the total number of Shares
outstanding, as calculated in the manner set forth in Regulation 13D-G.*

(v)   Loews owns 84% of the outstanding common stock of CNA and therefore,
may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of the 3,158,641 Shares
benenficially owned by CNA, or 25.5% of the total number of Shares
outstanding, as calculated in the manner set forth in Regulation 13D-G.*

To the best of the respective knowledge of Loews, CNA, Continental, Firemen's
and National-Ben, no director or executive officer of Loews, CNA,
Continental, Firemen's or National-Ben beneficially owns any Shares.

(b)  The persons named in response to Item 5(a) above are the only persons
having the power to vote or to direct the vote and the power to dispose of,
or to direct the disposition of, the Shares beneficially owned by each such
person.

___________________
* Based on the number of Shares outstanding
  on June 22, 1995 as reported by the Issuer.
<PAGE>
<PAGE>
(c)  None of Loews, CNA, Continental, Firemen's or National-Ben has effected
any transactions in the Shares in the past sixty days.

(d)  No person other than the persons named in response to Item 5(a) above
has the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends
from, or the profits from the sale of, the Shares beneficially owned by each
such person.

Item 6.  Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships with
                     Respect to Securities of the Issuer.
         -------------------------------------------------------------

To the best knowledge of Loews, CNA, Continental, Fireman's and National-Ben,
the only contract, arrangement, understanding or relationship (legal or
otherwise) with any person with respect to any securities of the Issuer,
including, but not limited to those types enumerated in Item 6 of Schedule
13D is a Stockholders Agreement dated as of May 17, 1993 by and among Gerald
R. Cysewski, Firemen's (as successor in interest to Continental), National-
Ben, Gerald A. Sherlock, Eva R. Reichl and the Issuer (the "Stockholders
Agreement").  The Stockholders Agreement, in pertinent part, (a) limits the
number of directors to six, (b) permits Eva R. Reichl to nominate one
director and (c) requires the parties to the Stockholder Agreement to vote
for such director.

Item 7.  Material to Be Filed as Exhibits.
         --------------------------------

The following items are filed as Exhibits to this Schedule 13D:

Exhibit 1 - an agreement regarding the filing of this Schedule 13D on behalf

                              STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT
                              ----------------------

     This STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is entered into as of May 17,
1993, by and among Gerald R. Cysewski, The Continental Corporation,
National - Ben Franklin Insurance Co. of Illinois, Gerald A. Sherlock
(collectively the "Stockholders"); Eva R Reichl (the "Stock Purchaser"); and
Cyanotech Corporation, a Nevada corporation (the "Corporation").

                                 R E C I T A L S

     A.  Each of the Stockholders is a stockholder of the Corporation and
owns the shares of the Corporation's Common Stock or its 8% Cumulative
Convertible Preferred Shares Series C (collectively the "Stock") as set forth
on Exhibit A attached hereto; and

     B.  Under Subscription Agreement dated as of May 15, 1993, between the
Corporation and Eva R. Reichl, The Stock Purchaser has agreed to purchase
from the Corporation 1,800,000 shares of its Common Stock, and the
Corporation has agreed to sell, in consideration of the payment of the
purchase price thereof, such shares of its Common Stock (the "Stock
Purchasers Shares"), subject to the condition, among others, that this
Agreement be duly executed and
delivered by the parties hereto; and

     C.  The Corporation and the Stockholders each desire that the
transactions contemplated by the Subscription Agreement be consummated and
are willing to enter into this Agreement for the benefit of all parties;

     In consideration of the mutual agreements and covenants contained herein
and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to legally bind themselves,
their successors, executors, heirs and assigns, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

     1.  Size of the Board of Director.  Without the prior written consent of
a majority of the votes entitled to be cast with respect to the shares of
Stock then held by the Stockholders and with respect to the Stock Purchaser
Shares then held by the Stock Purchaser, the Corporation shall not propose,
and the Stockholders shall not vote for, or take or cause to be taken any
action in favor of any resolution, Bylaw change or proposal that would result
in the Corporation's Board of Directors (the "Board") becoming larger than
six (6) members.  This agreement in no way cancels of modifies the rights of
holders of 12% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Shares Series A ("Series A")
to elect one director to the Board.  Should holders of Series A exercise
their right to elect one member to the Board, the Board would consist of a
maximum of seven members.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
     2.  Nomination of Directors.  The Corporation shall give written notice
to the Stock Purchaser of any election to the Board (the "Election Notice")
not less than 10 business days before any deadline for submitting names of
nominees for membership on the Board or 45 days before said election,
whichever is the longer period.  Eva R. Reichl may nominate one person for
election as director (the "Stock Purchaser Nominee").  The Stock Purchaser
shall give the Corporation and the Stockholders written notice of the name of
their respective Stock Purchaser Nominee, if any, within 10 business days
after receipt of the Election Notice.

     3.  Election of Directors.  At any election of directors of the
Corporation, the Stockholders and Stock Purchaser shall vote their shares so
as to elect the Stock Purchaser Nominee.

     4.  Specific Performance.  Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and
agrees that any other parties hereto would be irreparably damaged in the
event any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly,
each of the parties hereto agrees that each other party is entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and
provisions hereof in any action instituted in any foreign or domestic court
having subject matter jurisdiction, to the extent permitted by applicable
law.

     5.  No Waiver.  Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall cause the failure of the Corporation or the
Stockholders to insist upon strict compliance with any covenant, obligation,
condition or agreement contained herein to operate as a waiver of, or
estoppel with respect to, any which or any other covenant, obligation,
condition or agreement by the party entitled to the benefit thereto.

     6.  Severability.  If any provisions hereof shall be held invalid or
unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction or as a result of future
legislative action, such holding or action shall be strictly construed and,
subject to applicable law, shall not affect the validity or effect of any
other provisions hereof.

     7.  Authority.  Each party to this Agreement has full power and
authority to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement in accordance with
the
respective terms hereof. The Stockholders represent that in their individual
or corporate capacity they have the authority to bind the shares they
beneficially own, as listed on Exhibit A, to all the covenants,
representations and warranties contained herein.

     8.  Third Party Beneficiary.  This Agreement has been entered into for
the express benefit of the parties hereto. Nothing herein expressed or
implied is intended to or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any
person or corporation other than the parties hereto and their successors or
permitted assigns any rights or remedies under or by reason of this
Agreement.

     9.  Entire Agreement; Amendments.  This Agreement contains, and is
intended as, a complete statement of the entire agreement and understanding
between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes
all prior statements, representations, discussions, agreements, draft
agreements and undertakings, whether written or oral, expressed or implied,
of any and every nature with respect thereto. This Agreement cannot be
changed or terminated orally, and may only be amended by written agreement of
all of the parties.

    10.  Successors and Assigns.  All terms and provisions of this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
successors in interest of the respective parties hereto and by each
transferee of the shares of Stock held by the Stockholders.

    11.  Termination.  This Agreement terminates with respect to the Stock
Purchaser when such Stock Purchaser sells, transfers or disposes of any of
its Stock Purchaser Shares, other than by will, the laws of descent, or to
any entity controlled, directly or indirectly, by such Stock Purchaser.

    12  Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Hawaii applicable to agreements made

Re:    1,250,000 shares of the Issuer's 12% Cumulative, Convertible, Preferred  
       Shares, Series A (the "Series A Preferred Stock")

Dear Mr. Cysewski:

Per your conversations with Julian Baker at Loews Corporation, Firemen's
Insurance Company of Newark, New Jersey ("Firemen's") agrees to convert its
shares of Series A Preferred Stock within two weeks of Firemen's receipt of
notice of the reinstatement of the convertibility feature [as described in the
Articles of Incorporation of Cyanotech Corporation, as amended, (other than
with respect to the expiration date of the convertibility period)], if the
convertibility feature is reinstated within thirty days.  Please include with
the notice an opinion of counsel (which may be in-house counsel) which states
that the convertibility reinstatement was properly authorized.  Notices may be
sent by confirmed facsimile, express delivery or certified mail.  Please sign a
copy of this letter and return it to me by facsimile at (312)822-4175 if the
previous description reflects your understanding of the terms of the
reinstatement of the convertibility feature for the Series A Preferred Stock.

Sincerely,


Richard W. Dubberke
Vice President

Agreed:

Cyanotech Corporation
