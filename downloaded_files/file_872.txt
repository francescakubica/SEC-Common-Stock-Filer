convicted in a criminal proceeding. On January 27, 1995, Lockheed Corporation, 
one of the corporations that combined to form Lockheed Martin Corporation 
entered into a plea agreement pursuant to which Lockheed Corporation agreed to 
plead guilty to one count of conspiring to violate the bribery provisions of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and conspiracy to falsify its books, records and 
accounts.

     Lockheed Martin Corporation has not, during the last five years, been
subject to a judgment, decree or final order in joining future violations of, or
prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws
or finding any violation with respect to such laws.
