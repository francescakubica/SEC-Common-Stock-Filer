decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or
mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any

Item 3. Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.

        On September 18, 1995, Bed Preferred No. 1 acquired 8,333,334 shares of
the Issuer's Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Series A Preferred
Stock") for cash in the amount of $50,000,000 pursuant to that certain Series A
Convertible Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of May 18, 1995 by and
among the Issuer, AEW Partners, and Peter B. Bedford (the "Stock Purchase
Agreement"). AEW Partners assigned to Bed Preferred No. 1 its rights under the
Stock Purchase Agreement. Bed Preferred No. 1 used funds invested by its limited
partner in order to purchase the Series A Preferred Stock.

        On September 19, 1997, the Series A Preferred Stock owned of record by
Bed Preferred No. 1 became convertible into 4,166,667 shares of the Issuer's
Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Preferred Stock set forth in
the Issuer's Charter. On October 14, 1997, the Series A Preferred Stock was
converted into 4,166,667 shares of the Issuer's Common Stock. No additional
consideration was required or paid in connection with the conversion of the
Series A Preferred Stock of the Issuer into Common Stock of the Issuer.

Item 4. Purpose of Transaction.

        The purpose of the Reporting Persons in purchasing the Series A
Preferred Stock and converting the Series A Preferred Stock into Common Stock
was to acquire an equity interest in the Issuer in pursuit of the investment
objectives of Bed Preferred No. 1. Bed Preferred No. 1 holds the Securities for
investment purposes.

        The Reporting Persons intend to review continuously the equity position
of Bed Preferred No. 1 in the Issuer. Depending upon future evaluations of the
business prospects of the Issuer and upon other developments, including, but not
limited to, general economic and business conditions and money market and stock
market conditions, the Reporting Persons may determine from time to time to
increase or decrease the equity interest of Bed Preferred No. 1 in the Issuer by
acquiring additional shares of Common Stock, or by disposing of all or a portion
of the shares of Common Stock.

        Except as described in this Schedule 13D, none of the Reporting Persons
has any present plan or proposal which relates to or would result in:

        (a)     the acquisition of additional securities of the Issuer, or the
                disposition of securities of the Issuer;

        (b)     an extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger,
                reorganization or liquidation involving the Issuer or any of its
                subsidiaries;



                                  Page 9 of 16
<PAGE>   11

        (c)     a sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the Issuer
                or any of its subsidiaries;

        (d)     any change in the present Board of Directors or management of
                the Issuer, including any plans or proposals to change the
                number or term of directors or to fill any existing vacancies on
                the board;

        (e)     any material change in the present capitalization or dividend
                policy of the Issuer;

        (f)     any other material change in the Issuer's business or corporate
                structure;

        (g)     changes in the Issuer's charter, bylaws or instruments
                corresponding thereto or other actions which may impede the
                acquisition of control of the Issuer by any person;

        (h)     a class of securities of the Issuer to be delisted from a
                national securities exchange or to cease to be authorized to be
                quoted in the inter-dealer quotation system of a registered
                national securities association;

        (i)     a class of equity securities of the Issuer becoming eligible for
                termination of registration pursuant to Section 12(g)(4) of the
                Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange
                Act"); or

        (j)     any action similar to any of those enumerated above.

Item 5. Interest in Securities of the Issuer.

        (a) As of August 10, 1999, the Reporting Persons beneficially owned an
aggregate of 4,276,667 shares of the Issuer's Common Stock. These shares include
(i) 4,166,667 shares held directly by Bed Preferred No. 1, (ii) 55,000 shares
that may be purchased by Thomas G. Eastman upon the exercise of options, and
(iii) 55,000 shares that may be purchased by Thomas H. Nolan, Jr. upon the
exercise of options (the shares that may be purchased pursuant to options held
by Messrs. Eastman and Nolan are hereinafter referred to as the "Director Option
Shares").

        Messrs. Eastman and Nolan were initially designated by Bed Preferred No.
1 to serve on the Board of Directors of the Issuer as the "Series A Directors"
(see discussion in Item 6 below). Although both Mr. Eastman and Mr. Nolan
continue to sit on the Board, neither is considered to be a designee of Bed
Preferred No. 1 since the contractual rights of Bed Preferred No. 1 to designate
two Board members terminated when the Series A Preferred Stock was converted
into the Issuer's Common Stock. Each has, however, assigned to Bed Preferred No.
1 all of his rights to purchase the Director Option Shares. Such assignments are
discussed further in Item 6. Mr. Eastman and Mr. Nolan have each assigned to Bed
Preferred No. 1 options to purchase an additional 10,000 shares of the Issuer's
Common Stock, which options will not be exercisable until November 13, 1999.



                                 Page 10 of 16
<PAGE>   12

        To the best knowledge of the Reporting Persons, as of August 10, 1999,
none of the Reporting Persons, nor any officer or director of Eastrich No. 165
Corporation or AEW Inc. beneficially owned any other shares of Common Stock of
the Issuer with the exception of the Director Option Shares.

        (b) The Reporting Persons have the sole power to direct the voting and
disposition of the 4,166,677 shares of Common Stock held by it and the 110,000
Director Option Shares.

        (c) To the best knowledge of the Reporting Persons, none of the
Reporting Persons nor any officer or director of Eastrich No. 165 Corporation or
AEW Inc. has effected any transactions in the Common Stock during the past 60
days.

        (d) Not applicable.

        (e) Not applicable.

Item 6. Contracts, Arrangements, Understanding or Relationships With Respect
        to Securities of the Issuer.

        The Issuer is a real estate investment trust and the amount of its
shares that can be owned by a person are limited, pursuant to the Issuer's
Charter, to 5% of the outstanding shares of the Issuer's Capital Stock subject
to adjustment and certain exceptions. The Board of Directors of the Issuer
approved an exception for Bed Preferred No. 1 and has permitted Bed Preferred
No. 1 to own (i) 58% of the lesser of the number or value of the outstanding
shares of the Issuer's Common Stock and (ii) prior to the conversion of the
Series A Preferred Stock into shares of the Issuer's Common stock, 100% of the
outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, subject to certain
adjustments. Accordingly, if Bed Preferred No. 1 desired to acquire any
additional stock of the Issuer such that its ownership of the Issuer's Common
Stock would exceed 58%, such entity would need to obtain the approval of the
Issuer's Board of Directors.

        The Charter of the Issuer gave Bed Preferred No. 1 as the holder of the
Issuer's Series A Preferred Stock the right to elect two members of the Issuer's
Board of Directors. That right terminated at the time of the conversion of the
Series A Preferred Stock into shares of the Issuer's Common Stock.

        Thomas G. Eastman and Thomas H. Nolan, Jr. were initially designated by
Bed Preferred No. 1 to serve on the Board of Directors of the Issuer as the
Series A Directors. Messrs. Eastman and Nolan each entered into a Bedford
Directorship Agreement dated as of September 18, 1995 with AEW Partners. Under
the terms of the respective Bedford Directorship Agreements, all options granted
to Messrs. Eastman and Nolan under to Issuer's Director Stock Option Plan, and
the securities of the Issuer underlying the options, are to be held for the
benefit of Bed Preferred No. 1, as the assignee of AEW Partners.

        This Amendment No. 1 (the "Amendment") to the Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") among AEW Partners, L.P.,
Bedford Property Investors, Inc. and Peter B. Bedford, originally dated as of
May 18, 1995, is entered into this 11th day of September, 1995.

        The parties hereto wish to amend the Agreement.

        The parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

                                    AGREEMENT

        1. The second sentence of Section 4.6 of the Agreement is hereby deleted
in its entirety.

        2. Section 6 of the Agreement is hereby amended by adding thereto, as
Section 6.9, the following:

                6.9 REIT OWNERSHIP. During the period that AEW or its Preclosing
        Affiliate continues to own Shares representing more than 5% of the value
        of the outstanding shares of the Company, applying the stock ownership
        rules of Code Section 856(h) AEW or its Preclosing Affiliate shall
        continue to be treated as a partnership and no partner of AEW or member
        of its Preclosing Affiliate (other than AEW) will be treated as the
        owner of more than 8.2% of the Outstanding Shares of the Company;
        provided, however, that this percentage will be reduced in proportion to
        the reduction in the Outstanding Shares resulting from any redemption of
        the Shares.

        3. Section 10.1 of the Agreement is hereby amended by replacing the date
"September 15, 1995" in each place where it appears with the date "September 30,

                         BEDFORD DIRECTORSHIP AGREEMENT

        THIS BEDFORD DIRECTORSHIP AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is made and
entered into as of this 18th day of September, 1995 by and between Thomas G.
Eastman (the "Director") and AEW Partners, L.P. ("AEW").

                                 R E C I T A L S

        a. AEW has executed a Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with
Bedford Properties, Inc. ("Bedford") pursuant to which AEW will acquire
8,333,334 shares of Series A Preferred Stock of Bedford.

        b. In turn, the shares of Series A Preferred Stock of Bedford will allow
AEW to appoint two directors to the Bedford Board of Directors.

        c. The Director has been appointed by AEW to serve as a Director of
Bedford and has agreed to do so, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

        THE PARTIES AGREE AS FOLLOWS:

        1. Bedford Stock Options. Pursuant to the terms of the Bedford
Nonemployee Director Stock Option Plan, the Director will receive options to
purchase 50,000 shares of Common Stock of Bedford (the "Options"). The parties
agree that to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Options and the Shares
underlying the Options (the "Shares") will be held for the benefit of AEW. Upon
written request by AEW, the Director shall exercise the Options and transfer the
underlying Shares to AEW. AEW shall provide the Director with all necessary
consideration required to exercise the Options.



<PAGE>   2

        2. Tax Indemnification; Indemnification For Breach. AEW hereby
indemnifies and holds Director harmless from and against any federal or state
tax liability which Director or his legal representatives may now, or hereafter,
be held liable for, or be claimed to be liable for, in any way relating to (i)
Director receiving or holding the Options, (ii) Director holding the Shares
after exercise, or (iii) Director's transfer of the Shares to AEW, including,
without limitation, any legal or other costs incurred by Director in connection
with any claim made by federal or state tax authorities relating to any such tax
liability or claim of tax liability. For this purpose, a tax liability shall
include taxes and interest and penalties related thereto. The parties recognize
the possibility that payments made by AEW to Director hereunder may themselves
be subject to tax and intend this indemnification to apply also to any such
payment with the objective that Director shall receive sufficient payments from
AEW to cover fully Director's net tax liability on all payments so received
(after giving effect to any refunds of tax or interest), and any costs,
including without limitation, legal costs associated with any claim of tax
liability, and that Director shall not incur any out-of-pocket expense after
receipt of AEW's full indemnification.

        AEW hereby also indemnifies and holds Director harmless from and against
any claims, suits, actions, judgments, damages, or other liability now or
hereafter incurred by Director or his representatives as a result of any direct
or indirect claim by Bedford or any representative thereof, that Director's
holding of the Options and the Shares for the



                                       2
<PAGE>   3

benefit of AEW was in breach or violation of the Stock Option Agreement under
which the Options were provided to Director.

        3. Payments.

        All payments pursuant to this Agreement shall be made within 10 days of
AEW's receipt of a written notice from Director indicating the reasonable basis
for an indemnification payment such as a notice of deficiency or an opinion of
counsel to the effect that income related to the Options or the Shares should be
included in Director's tax return. In case of any "gross-up" payment as to which
the amount of the tax liability cannot then be reasonably determined, Director
shall receive additional indemnification at the time of the "gross-up" payment
on the assumption that Director is subject to the highest rate of federal and
state taxation. Any such payment shall be subject to adjustment when its amount
is determined as by the filing of a return.

        IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the
date first above written.

agree that to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Options and the Shares
underlying the Options (the "Shares") will be held for the benefit of AEW. Upon
written request by AEW, the Director shall exercise the Options and transfer the
underlying Shares to AEW.

        AEW shall provide the Director with all necessary consideration required
to exercise the Options.

        2. Tax Indemnification; Indemnification For Breach. AEW hereby
indemnifies and holds Director harmless from and against any federal or state
tax liability which Director or his legal representatives may now, or hereafter,
be held liable for, or be claimed to be liable for, in any way relating to (i)
Director receiving or holding the Options, (ii) Director holding the Shares
after exercise, or (iii) Director's transfer of the Shares to AEW, including,
without limitation, any legal or other costs incurred by Director in connection
with any claim made by federal or state tax authorities relating to any such tax
liability or claim of tax liability. For this purpose, a tax liability shall
include taxes and interest and penalties related thereto. The parties recognize
the possibility that payments made by AEW to Director hereunder may themselves
be subject to tax and intend this indemnification to apply also to any such
payment with the objective that Director shall receive sufficient payments from
AEW to cover fully Director's net tax liability on all payments so received
(after giving effect to any refunds of tax or interest), and any costs,
including without limitation, legal costs associated with any claim of tax
liability, and that Director shall not incur any out-of-pocket expense after
receipt of AEW's full indemnification.

        AEW hereby also indemnifies and holds Director harmless from and against
any claims, suits, actions, judgments, damages, or other liability now or
hereafter incurred by Director or his representatives as a result of any direct
or indirect claim by Bedford or any representative thereof, that Director's
holding of the Options and the Shares for the

benefit of AEW was in breach or violation of the Stock Option Agreement under
which the Options were provided to Director.

        3. Payments.

        All payments pursuant to this Agreement shall be made within 10 days of
AEW's receipt of a written notice from Director indicating the reasonable basis
for an indemnification payment such as a notice of deficiency or an opinion of
counsel to the effect that income related to the Options or the Shares should be
included in Director's tax return. In case of any "gross-up" payment as to which
the amount of the tax liability cannot then be reasonably determined, Director
shall receive additional indemnification at the time of the "gross-up" payment
on the assumption that Director is subject to the highest rate of federal and
state taxation. Any such payment shall be subject to adjustment when its amount
is determined as by the filing of a return.

        IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the
date first above written.
