                                  SCHEDULE 13D

         This Amendment No. 2 reflects open market sales of 2,428,900 shares of
common stock, par value $.01 per share ("Common Stock"), of Biogen, Inc.
("Biogen") by (i) BB Biotech AG, a Swiss corporation ("BB Biotech"), (ii)
Biotech Invest S.A., a Panamanian corporation ("Biotech Invest"), (iii) Biotech
Focus, S.A., a Panamanian corporation ("Biotech Focus") and (iv) Biotech Target
S.A., a Panamanian corporation ("Biotech Target", Biotech Invest, Biotech Focus
and Biotech Target are collectively referred to as the "Biotech Subsidiaries").
As of February 23, 1996, BB Biotech and the Biotech Subsidiaries ceased to have
beneficial ownership of more than 5 percent of the Common Stock of Biogen.

ITEM 5.  INTEREST IN SECURITIES OF THE ISSUER

         ITEMS 5(a), (b), (c) AND (e) ARE AMENDED IN THEIR ENTIRETY TO READ AS
FOLLOWS:

         (a)     The Biotech Subsidiaries collectively held 2,840,000 shares,
or approximately 8.25 percent, of Biogen Common Stock on July 6, 1994 (the
filing date of Amendment No. 1 to Schedule 13D).  As of February 23, 1996, the
Biotech Subsidiaries held 1,693,400 shares, or approximately 4.61 percent, of
Biogen Common Stock.  Since that time, the Biogen Subsidiaries have sold shares
in the open market to reduce their holdings to 411,100 shares, or approximately
1.12 percent of the outstanding Common Stock of Biogen as of March 7, 1996.  As
a result, BB Biotech may be deemed to be the indirect beneficial owner of the
411,100 shares of Biogen Common Stock held directly in the aggregate by the
Biotech Focus as of March 7, 1996, which represents approximately 1.12 percent
of the outstanding shares of Biogen Common Stock.  No shares of Biogen Common
