ITEM 3. SOURCE AND AMOUNT OF FUNDS OR OTHER CONSIDERATION

        Pursuant to an order of the United States Bankruptcy Court for
the District of Delaware, dated August  26, 1996, the First Amended Plan
of Reorganization of Morrison Knudsen Corporation ("MKC") under Chapter
11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the "Plan") was confirmed.  Under the Plan,
DKAP has become entitled to receive 466,175 shares of the Company Common
Stock.  Under the Plan, shareholders of MKC became entitled to
participate in a rights offering pursuant to which such holders received,
inter alia, the right to acquire Common Stock of the Company during a
specified period ending on September 24, 1996.

        The Plan required creditors of MKC, including DKAP, to be bound
by the terms of a Stockholders Agreement (described below).  Accordingly,
DKAP may be deemed to be a party to such Stockholders Agreement with
certain other stockholders (the "Stockholders") pursuant to which the
shares of Common Stock of the Company owned by DKAP and the Stockholders
exceeds 5% of the amount of Common Stock of the Company outstanding and
must be voted for certain nominees for election to the Company's board of
directors and certain transfer restrictions apply to DKAP and the
Stockholders.  DKAP and the Stockholders may be deemed to constitute a
group for purposes of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act.  The
Reporting Parties disclaim beneficial ownership of the shares of Common
Stock of the Company held by the Stockholders and disclaim that they
constitute a group with the Stockholders for purposes of Section 13(d)(3)
of the Exchange Act.

ITEM 4. PURPOSE OF THE TRANSACTION.

        The Reporting Parties became entitled to the 466,175 shares of
the Company Common Stock in the manner described in Item 3 above.

        The Reporting Parties have no intention, plan or proposal with
respect to:

        (a)  The acquisition by any person of additional securities of
             the issuer, or the disposition of securities of the issuer;

        (b)  An extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger,
             reorganization or liquidation, involving the issuer or any
             of its subsidiaries;

        (c)  A sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the
             issuer or any of its subsidiaries;

        (d)  Any change in the present Board of Directors or management
             of the issuer, including any plans or proposals to change
             the number or term of directors or to fill any existing
             vacancies on the Board;

        (e)  Any material change in the present capitalization or
             dividend policy of the issuer;

        (f)  Any other material change in the issuer's business or
             corporate structure, including but not limited to, if the
             issuer is a registered closed-end investment company, any
             plans or proposals to make any changes in its investment
             policy for which a vote is required by Section 13 of the
             Investment Company Act of 1940;

        (g)  Changes in the issuer's charter, bylaws or instruments
             corresponding thereto or other actions which may impede the
             acquisition of control of the issuer by any person;

        (h)  Causing a class of securities of the issuer to be delisted
             from a national securities exchange or to cease to be
             authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system
             of a registered national securities association;

        (i)  A class of equity securities of the issuer becoming eligible
             for termination of registration pursuant to Section 12(g)(4)
             of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; or

        (j)  Any action similar to any of those enumerated above.

        Each of the Reporting Parties, however, may, at any time and from
time to time, and reserves the right to, acquire additional securities of
the Company, dispose of any such securities of the Company or formulate
other plans or proposals regarding the Company or its securities, to the
extent deemed advisable by such Reporting Party in light of its general
investment policies, market conditions or other factors.

ITEM 5. INTEREST IN SECURITIES OF THE ISSUER.

        (a)  Following confirmation of the Plan on September 14, 1996,
the Reporting Parties became entitled to receive 466,175 shares of Common
Stock of the Company, which amount will constitute less than 5% of the
shares of Common Stock of the Company estimated to be outstanding as of
September 14, 1996.

        Pursuant to a Shareholders Agreement, dated as of June 20, 1986
between the Company and MKC (the Stockholders Agreement"), no holder who
receives shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Plan may transfer any
shares of Common Stock to any person except under certain circumstances.
The restrictions on transfers under the Stockholders Agreement will not
apply to any subsequent transferee so long as the transfer was permitted
under the Stockholders Agreement.

        Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, certain persons,
including DKAP, have agreed not to (a) solicit proxies, (b) initiate any
stockholder proposal for a tender offer, change of control or attempt to
convene a stockholders meeting or (c) otherwise seek to influence or
control the management or policies of the Company.  The above
restrictions expire on the second anniversary of the distribution of the
Common Stock of the Company under the Plan (subject to certain alternate
termination provisions).

        The Stockholders Agreement also provides certain holders,
including DKAP, with demand registration rights and piggyback
registration rights.  Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, certain
holders may demand that the Company file a registration statement under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") for the
resale of the Common Stock received by such holders in accordance with
the Plan or, if the Company has filed a registration statement pursuant
to the Securities Act, such holders may include shares of Common Stock
received in accordance with the Plan on the Company's registration
statement.

        (b)  The Reporting Parties have shared power to vote or direct
the vote and dispose or direct the disposition of 466,175 shares of
Common Stock of the company.

        (c)  During the past 60 days, the Reporting Parties have not
effected any transactions in the securities of the Company, except as
described in Item 3 above.



ITEM 6. CONTRACTS, ARRANGEMENTS, UNDERSTANDINGS OR RELATIONSHIPS WITH
        RESPECT TO SECURITIES OF THE ISSUER

        Except as described in Item 5 above, the Reporting Parties do not
have any contract, arrangement, understanding or relationship with any
other person with respect to any security of the Company.  In addition,
the Reporting Parties expressly disclaim that they are a member of a
group as a result of the imposition of the Plan and the Stockholders
Agreement.

                                 INTRODUCTION

     Morrison Knudsen Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("MK" or the
"Debtor"), proposes the following first amended plan of reorganization (the
"Plan") for the satisfaction of the Debtor's outstanding creditor claims and
equity interests.  Reference is made to the Debtor's second amended
disclosure statement, distributed contemporaneously with the Plan (the
"Disclosure Statement"), for a discussion of the Debtor's history,
businesses, properties, results of operations and projections for future
operations, and for a summary and analysis of the Plan and certain related
matters, including the Merger, which is a central feature of the Plan.  All
Holders of Claims against and Interests in the Debtor entitled to vote on the
Plan are encouraged to read the Plan and the Disclosure Statement in their
entirety before voting to accept or reject the Plan.  Subject to certain
restrictions and requirements set forth in the Plan and the Merger Agreement,
the Debtor reserves the right to alter, amend, modify, revoke or withdraw the
Plan prior to its consummation.

     Unless the Merger Agreement is terminated as provided therein, the
Merger shall be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Merger
Agreement and the Plan will become effective simultaneously with such
consummation.  If the Merger Agreement is terminated as provided therein, the
Plan will nonetheless become effective in accordance with its terms, which
provide for alternative treatment of various matters in that event.

          (a)  Classification:  Class MK-8 consists of the Interests of (i)

Subsequent Equity Recovery, on or as soon as is practicable after the
Effective Date, each Holder of an Allowed Class MK-8 Interest shall receive,
in full and final satisfaction of such Interest, (A) its Pro Rata Share of
Combined Company Warrants (or, if the Merger Agreement is terminated, New MK
Warrants) and (B) unless the Merger Agreement is terminated, a number, equal
to the number of  shares of Old Common  Stock held by  such Holder as of  the
applicable  Distribution  Due, of  Combined  Company  Rights.   Any  Combined
Company Rights distributed pursuant to this Section III.B.8 may be exercised
in  accordance with  the  provisions of  Section  VII.B.6 of  the  Plan.  
In addition  to  the  distribution  of Combined  Company  Warrants  and

receive or retain any property under the Plan on account of such Interests.

          (c)  Voting:  Class MK-9 is impaired and because no distribution
of property will be made to Holders of Class MK-9 Interests, nor will such
Holders retain any property, Class MK-9 is deemed not to have accepted the
Plan.

C.   SPECIAL PROVISIONS REGARDING UNIMPAIRED CLAIMS

     Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, nothing shall affect the
Debtor's or the Reorganized Debtor's rights and legal and equitable defenses
in respect of any Unimpaired Claims, including but not limited to all rights
in respect of legal and equitable defenses to setoffs or recoupments against
Unimpaired Claims.

D.   ACCRUAL OF POSTPETITION INTEREST; PAYMENT OF POSTPETITION FEES AND

Debt Claims and the fees and expenses of the Existing Indebtedness Agent and
the Lender Steering Committee shall be paid during the Chapter 11 Case as
they come due under the terms of the Override Agreement at the applicable
non-default contractual rate.  Additionally, the reasonable fees and expenses
of counsel to, and the members of, the Unofficial Equity Committee shall be
paid promptly by the Debtor or Reorganized Debtor; provided, however, that
if the amount of counsel's fees and expenses payable hereunder is not agreed
to, then only the undisputed amount, if any, of such fees and expenses shall
be paid and counsel's sole recourse with respect to the balance sought will
be to request payment of the same pursuant to section 503(b) of the
Bankruptcy Code; and provided further, that the aggregate fees and expenses
payable to the members of the Unofficial Equity Committee shall not exceed
$100,000.  To the extent not previously paid when due or otherwise provided
for under the Plan, such undisputed interest, fees and expenses, together
with any unpaid professional fees due the Holders of Other Secured Claims,
shall be paid in Cash on the Effective Date, together with any additional
amounts required to be paid in respect of Unimpaired Claims pursuant to
Section 1124.  Except as otherwise provided above or in the Plan, no Holder
of an Allowed Unsecured Claim shall be entitled to the accrual of
postpetition interest or the payment by the Debtor or Reorganized Debtor of
postpetition interest on account of such Claim for any purpose; provided,
however, that interest, fees and other charges shall continue to accrue under
the Metra Credit Agreement and the Metra Guaranty to the Effective Date for
purposes of determining the Metra Ceiling Amount.


                                 ARTICLE IV.

                     ACCEPTANCE OR REJECTION OF THE PLAN

A.   VOTING CLASSES

     Each Holder of an Allowed Class MK-3, MK-4 or MK-6 Claim or an Allowed
Class MK-8 Interest shall be entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan.

B.   ACCEPTANCE BY IMPAIRED CLASSES

     An Impaired Class of Claims shall have accepted the Plan if (i) the
Holders (other than any Holder designated under section 1126(e) of the
Bankruptcy Code) of at least two-thirds in amount of the Allowed Claims
actually voting in such Class have voted to accept the Plan and (ii) the
Holders (other than any Holder designated under section 1126(e) of the
Bankruptcy Code) of more than one-half in number of the Allowed Claims
actually voting in such Class have voted to accept the Plan.  An Impaired
Class of Interests shall have accepted the Plan if the Holders (other than
any Holder designated under section 1126(e) of the Bankruptcy Code) of at
least two-thirds in amount of the Allowed Interests actually voting in such
Class have voted to accept the Plan.

C.   PRESUMED ACCEPTANCE OF PLAN

     Classes MK-1, MK-2, MK-5 and MK-7 are unimpaired under the Plan and,
therefore, conclusively are presumed to have accepted the Plan pursuant to
section 1126(f) the Bankruptcy Code.

D.   DEEMED NON-ACCEPTANCE OF PLAN

     Holders of Class MK-9 Interests shall not receive or retain any property
under the Plan on account of their Interests, and therefore, Class MK-9 is
deemed not to have accepted the Plan pursuant to section 1126(g) of the
Bankruptcy Code.

E.   NON-CONSENSUAL CONFIRMATION

     The Debtor will seek Confirmation of the Plan under section 1129(b) of
the Bankruptcy Code in view of the deemed non-acceptance by Class MK-9.  In
the event that any Impaired Class of Claims or Interests does not accept the
Plan in accordance with section 1126 of the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtor
hereby requests that the Bankruptcy Court confirm the Plan in accordance with
section 1129(b) of the Bankruptcy Code.  Subject to the Merger Agreement, the
Debtor reserves the right to modify the Plan to the extent, if any, that
Confirmation pursuant to section 1129(b) of the Bankruptcy Code requires
modification.


                                  ARTICLE V.

                     MEANS FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLAN

A.   CONTINUED CORPORATE EXISTENCE, VESTING OF ASSETS IN THE REORGANIZED
DEBTOR AND PRESERVATION OF RIGHTS OF ACTION

     1.   CONTINUED CORPORATE EXISTENCE AND VESTING OF ASSETS

     On the Effective Date, MK will merge into Washington pursuant to the
Merger Agreement, unless the Merger Agreement is terminated.  The
Reorganized Debtor will continue to exist after the Effective Date as a
separate corporate entity, with all of the powers of a corporation under the
Delaware General Corporation Law and without prejudice to any right to alter
or terminate their existence (whether by merger or otherwise).  Except as
otherwise provided in the Plan, on and after the Effective Date, all
property of the Estate of the Debtor, including all claims, rights and
causes of action (other than those released pursuant to Section V.E below),
and any property acquired by the Debtor or Reorganized Debtor under or in
connection with the Plan, shall vest in the Reorganized Debtor free and
clear of all Claims, liens, charges, other encumbrances and Interests.  On
and after the Effective Date, the Reorganized Debtor may operate its
businesses and may use, acquire and dispose of property and compromise or
settle any Claims or Interests without supervision or approval by the
Bankruptcy Court and free of any restrictions of the Bankruptcy Code or
Bankruptcy Rules, other than restrictions expressly imposed by the Plan or
the Confirmation Order.  Without limiting the foregoing, the Reorganized
Debtor may pay the charges that it incurs on or after the Effective Date for
Professionals' fees, disbursements, expenses or related support services
without application to the Bankruptcy Court, except for compensation or
reimbursement of expenses for any services rendered after the Effective Date
in connection with any applications for compensation or reimbursement
pending on the Effective Date or Filed and served after the Effective Date
pursuant to Section II.A.2 above.

     2.   PRESERVATION OF RIGHTS OF ACTION

     Except as provided in Section V.E below, or in any contract, instrument,
release, indenture or other agreement entered into in connection with the
Plan, in accordance with section 1123(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, the
Reorganized Debtor shall retain and may enforce any claims, rights and causes
of action that the Debtor or its Estate may hold against any entity,
including but not limited to the claims, rights and causes of action set
forth in Exhibit U. Failure to list a claim, right or cause of action on
Exhibit U shall not constitute a waiver or release by the Debtor of such
claim, right or cause of action.  The Reorganized Debtor or its successors
may pursue such retained claims, rights or causes of action, as appropriate,
in accordance with the best interests of the Reorganized Debtor.

B.   THE RESTRUCTURING TRANSACTIONS

     1.   THE MERGER

          (a)  CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER

     Simultaneously with the commencement of the Effective Date, unless the
Merger Agreement is terminated, MK shall take all such actions, including
without limitation all actions set forth in Articles 2 and 3 of the Merger
Agreement, as may be necessary or appropriate to effect the Merger on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. 
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, promptly upon the
satisfaction or waiver (pursuant to Section IX.C) of each of the conditions
set forth in Section IX.B, MK will cause the Merger Agreement or a
certificate of merger conforming to the applicable provisions of the Delaware
General Corporation Law to be filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware
pursuant to applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law and
will take or cause to be taken all other actions, including making
appropriate filings or recordings, that may be required by the Delaware
General Corporation Law or then-applicable law in connection with the Merger.

          (b)  CANCELLATION OF CAPITAL STOCK AND EXISTING LOAN DOCUMENTS;
SURRENDER OF SECURITIES AND OTHER DOCUMENTATION

     On the Effective Date, the Capital Stock (whether issued and
outstanding or held in the treasury of MK immediately prior to the Effective
Date), the Rights, the Existing Loan Documents, the Transit Reimbursement
Agreement and the Transit Security Agreement shall be deemed to be
cancelled, extinguished, retired and of no further force and effect, in all
events without any further action on the part of the Debtor, the Reorganized
Debtor, the holders of Capital Stock or any other entity.  The Holders of
such canceled securities and other documentation shall have no rights
arising from or relating to such securities or other documentation, or the
cancellation thereof, except the rights provided pursuant to the Plan;
provided, however, that no distribution under the Plan shall be made to or
on behalf of any Holder of any Allowed Claim or Allowed Interest evidenced
by such canceled securities or other documentation unless or until such
securities or documentation are received by the Disbursing Agent pursuant to
Section VII.H below.  On the Effective Date, the Rights Agreement shall be
deemed to be cancelled, retired and of no further force and effect, without
any further action on the part of the Debtor or the Reorganized Debtor.

          (c)  EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON TRANSFER OF SECURITIES

     Unless the Merger Agreement is terminated, the shares of Combined
Company Common Stock shall be distributed to Holders of Allowed Class MK-6
Claims and to the Liquidating Trust (and, if applicable, to the Holders of
Allowed Class MK-8 Interests), and the Combined Company Warrants and the
Combined Company Rights shall be distributed to Holders of Allowed Class MK-8
Interests, pursuant to the Plan to the same effect as if (i) immediately
prior to the Merger on the Effective Date, newly issued shares of common
stock of Reorganized MK had been distributed to Holders of Allowed Class MK-6
Claims and to the Liquidating Trust (and, if applicable, to the Holders of
Allowed Class MK-8 Interests) and the formerly outstanding shares of Old
Common Stock had been converted into warrants to purchase shares of common
stock of Reorganized MK, and (ii) immediately thereafter, pursuant to the
Merger, the newly issued shares of common stock of Reorganized MK were
converted into Combined Company Common Stock and the warrants to purchase
shares of common stock of Reorganized MK were converted into Combined Company
Warrants.

          (d)  THE REORGANIZED DEBTOR'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE PLAN

     From and after the Effective Date, the Reorganized Debtor will perform
the obligations of the Debtor under the Plan.
 
     2.   NEW LETTER OF CREDIT REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT AND NEW GUARANTIES

     On the Effective Date, the Reorganized Debtor shall enter into New
Letter of Credit Reimbursement Agreements with issuers of Existing Letters
of Credit and New Guaranties with holders of Existing Guaranties.

     3.   ISSUANCE OF SECURITIES AND RELATED DOCUMENTATION

     On the Effective Date:

          (a)  The Combined Company shall issue the shares of Combined
Company Common Stock to be distributed pursuant to the Plan (or, if the
Merger Agreement is terminated, Reorganized MK shall issue the shares of New
MK Common Stock to be distributed pursuant to the Plan).

          (b)  The Combined Company shall issue the Combined Company Series
A Preferred Stock to be distributed pursuant to the Plan (or, if the Merger
Agreement  is terminated,  Reorganized MK shall  issue the  shares of  New MK
Series A Preferred Stock to be distributed pursuant to the Plan).

          (c)  The Combined Company shall issue, pursuant to the Combined
Company Warrant Agreement, the Combined Company Warrants to be distributed

MK shall issue, pursuant to the New MK Warrant Agreement, the New MK Warrants
to be distributed to the Plan).

          (d)  The Combined Company shall issue the Combined Company Rights
to be distributed pursuant to the Plan (unless the Merger Agreement is
terminated).

          (e)  The transferees of the Combined Company Common Stock (or, if
the Merger Agreement is terminated, the New MK Common Stock) shall be deemed
to have entered into the Combined Company Registration Rights Agreement (or,
if the Merger Agreement is terminated, the New MK Registration Rights
Agreement) without further action on the part of the Debtor, Reorganized
Debtor or any other entity.

     4.   ESTABLISHMENT OF LIQUIDATING TRUST

     On or as soon as practicable after the Combined Company Rights
Expiration Date, the Liquidating Trust shall be established pursuant to the
Liquidating Trust Agreement and the Plan.  Unless the Merger Agreement is
terminated, and subject to the exercise of the Combined Company Rights, (a)
the Liquidating Trust MK Rail Stock, (b) the Liquidating Trust MK Rail Note
Proceeds (and, if the MK Rail Note has not been cancelled in accordance with
the MK Rail Note Cancellation Agreement, the MK Rail Note), (c) the
Liquidating Trust Cash Distribution, (d) the Liquidating Trust Combined
Company Common Stock, (e) the Combined Company Series A Preferred Stock, (f)
the Liquidating Trust Class MK-3 Rights Exercise Proceeds, and (g) the
Liquidating Trust Class MK-6 Rights Exercise Proceeds, or the proceeds of
each thereof, shall be conveyed to the Liquidating Trust.  If the Merger
Agreement is terminated, (a) the Liquidating Trust MK Rail Stock, (b) the
Liquidating Trust MK Rail Note Proceeds (and, if the MK Rail Note has not
been cancelled in accordance with the MK Rail Note Cancellation Agreement,
the MK Rail Note), (c) the Liquidating Trust New MK Common Stock, and (d) the
New MK Series A Preferred Stock, or the proceeds of each thereof, shall be
conveyed to the Liquidating Trust.

     If, prior to the Combined Company Rights Expiration Date (or, if the
Merger Agreement is terminated, the Effective Date), (a) the Metra Final
Accounting Date, as defined in the Liquidating Trust Agreement, has occurred,
(b) the MK Rail Note has been cancelled in accordance with the terms of the
MK Rail Note Cancellation Agreement, and (c) the Debtor determines, in
accordance with the Residual Equity Recovery Exhibit, that no Subsequent
Equity Recovery will occur, then (a) the Liquidating Trust shall not be
established, (b) the Combined Company Series A Preferred Stock (or, if the
Merger Agreement is terminated, the New MK Series A Preferred Stock) shall
be distributed, subject (unless the Merger Agreement is terminated) to the
exercise of the Combined Company Rights, to Holders of Allowed Class MK-6
Claims in accordance with the provisions of the Creditor Distribution Exhibit
that are applicable solely in the event that the Liquidating Trust is not
established, and (c) all provisions of the Plan, including all exhibits
hereto, relating to the Liquidating Trust shall be of no force or effect, and
the property to be otherwise distributed to the Liquidating Trust shall be
distributed, subject (unless the Merger Agreement is terminated) to the
exercise of the Combined Company Rights, to Holders of Allowed Class MK-3 or
MK-6 Claims, as the case may be, in accordance with the Creditor Distribution
Exhibit.

     5.   ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW CREDIT FACILITY

     On the Effective Date, if the Merger Agreement is terminated, the
Reorganized Debtor shall establish the New Credit Facility by entering into
the New Credit Facility Documents.

     6.   PROCEDURES FOR EXERCISE OF COMBINED COMPANY RIGHTS

     (a)  Each Combined Company Right may be exercised by the holder thereof
at any time during the Combined Company Rights Exercise Period to purchase
a portion of the Combined Company Rights Aggregate Consideration equal to the
quotient that results from dividing (i) one by (ii) the number of Combined
Company Rights issued under the Plan (the exercise of any Combined Company
Rights in such manner being referred to as a "Primary Exercise").  Although
a holder of Combined Company Rights may exercise all or any portion of such
holder's Combined Company Rights pursuant to a Primary Exercise, all such
Combined Company Rights that are to be exercised by such holder pursuant to
a Primary Exercise shall be exercised concurrently.  Any holder of Combined
Company Rights that seeks to exercise all of such holder's Combined Company
Rights pursuant to a Primary Exercise may also seek to exercise a notional
number of additional Combined Company Rights not to exceed the difference
that results from subtracting (i) the number of Combined Company Rights
sought to be exercised by such holder pursuant to a Primary Exercise from
(ii) the number of Combined Company Rights issued under the Plan (the
exercise of any Combined Company Rights in such manner being referred to as
an "Oversubscription Exercise").  Any exercise of Combined Company Rights
pursuant to a Primary Exercise or an Oversubscription Exercise will be
irrevocable.  Any exercise of Combined Company Rights pursuant to an 
Oversubscription Exercise will be subject to prorationing as described in
clause (d) below in the event that the total number of Combined Company
Rights sought to be exercised pursuant to Primary Exercises and
Oversubscription Exercises exceeds the number of Combined Company Rights
issued under the Plan.

     (b)  In order for any Primary Exercise (and any related Oversubscription
Exercise) of Combined Company Rights to be valid and effective, the holder
of Combined Company Rights seeking to effect such Primary Exercise must have
been the Holder of the Allowed Class MK-8 Interests in respect of which the
Combined Company Rights subject to such Primary Exercise were issued pursuant
to Section III.B.8 of the Plan and must deliver to the Disbursing Agent prior
to the Combined Company Rights Expiration Date a properly completed and duly
executed Exercise Notice which (i) indicates the number of Combined Company
Rights sought to be exercised pursuant to a Primary Exercise and the number,
if any, of Combined Company Rights sought to be exercised pursuant to an
Oversubscription Exercise and (ii) is accompanied by a certified check or
bank draft drawn upon a United States bank or wire transfer in an amount
equal to the sum of (a) the product of the Combined Company Rights Exercise
Price and the number of Combined Company Rights sought to be exercised
pursuant to a Primary Exercise and (b) the product of the Combined Company
Rights Exercise Price and the number, if any, of Combined Company Rights
sought to be exercised pursuant to an Oversubscription Exercise.  The
foregoing items will not be deemed to have been timely delivered to the
Disbursing Agent (and thus the attempted exercise of Combined Company Rights
pursuant to a Primary Exercise and/or an Oversubscription Exercise will not
be valid or effective) unless they are actually received by the Disbursing
Agent at the address specified therefor in the instructions (the "Exercise
Instructions") accompanying the form of Exercise Notice to be provided
pursuant to clause (e) below prior to the Combined Rights Expiration Date and
are completed and executed in conformity with the Exercise Instructions.

     (c)  As promptly as practicable following the Combined Company Rights
Expiration Date, the Disbursing Agent will mail to each holder of Combined
Company Rights that has sought to exercise Combined Company Rights in a
Primary Exercise and/or an Oversubscription Exercise a written statement
specifying the number of Combined Company Rights that were validly and
effectively exercised by such holder (after giving effect, if applicable, to
prorationing pursuant to clause (d) below of Combined Company Rights sought
to be exercised by such holder pursuant to an Oversubscription Exercise) and
the quantity or magnitude of each form of consideration included in the
portion of the Combined Company Rights Aggregate Consideration purchased upon
such exercise of such Combined Company Rights, together with (i) a check in
the amount of the sum of the portion of the Cash Distribution so purchased,
the portion of the MK Rail Note Proceeds so purchased and, if applicable, the
amount being refunded (without interest) in respect of the Combined Company
Rights Exercise Price relating to any Combined Company Rights that were not
validly and effectively exercised by such holder as a result of untimeliness,
noncompliance with the requirements specified herein or in the Exercise
Instructions, prorationing pursuant to clause (d) below or otherwise and (ii)
stock certificates representing the shares of each class of stock so
purchased.  No fractional shares of stock will be delivered upon the exercise
of any Combined Company Right.  When any exercise of Combined Company Rights
would otherwise result in the purchase of a number of shares of any class of
stock that is not a whole number, the actual number of shares of stock of
such class that will be purchased upon such exercise shall be rounded to the
next higher or lower number as follows:  (a) fractions of 1/2 or greater will
be rounded to the next higher whole number and (b) fractions of less than 1/2
will be rounded to the next lower whole number.

     (d)  In the event that the total number of Combined Company Rights
sought to be exercised pursuant to Primary Exercises and Oversubscription
Exercises exceeds the number of Combined Company Rights issued under the
Plan, (i) all Combined Company Rights that shall have otherwise been validly
and effectively exercised pursuant to Primary Exercises shall be deemed to
have been validly and effectively exercised and (ii) the number of Combined
Company Rights that shall be deemed to have been validly and effectively
exercised by any holder of Combined Company Rights pursuant to an
Oversubscription Exercise (assuming that all other requirements for valid and
effective exercise shall have been satisfied) shall be determined by (a)
multiplying the aggregate number of Combined Company Rights that were not
validly and effectively exercised pursuant to Primary Exercises by a
fraction, the numerator of which will be the number of Combined Company
Rights issued under the Plan to such holder and the denominator of which
shall be the number of Combined Company Rights issued under the Plan to 
all holders of Combined Company Rights who shall have exercised Combined
Company Rights pursuant to Oversubscription Exercises and (b) eliminating any
resulting fractions.  If the prorationing pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence would otherwise result in any holder being deemed to have
validly and effectively exercised a greater number of Combined Company Rights
than such holder sought to exercise pursuant to its Oversubscription
Exercise, then such holder will be deemed to have validly and effectively
exercised only that number of Combined Company Rights which such holder
sought to exercise pursuant to its Oversubscription Exercise and any
remaining Combined Company Rights not otherwise deemed to have been validly
and effectively exercised will be deemed to have been validly and effectively
exercised by other holders of Combined Company Rights that have made
Oversubscription Exercises on the basis set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence.  This proration process will be repeated as necessary
until all Combined Company Rights shall have been deemed to have been validly
and effectively exercised by such holders.

     (e)  In order to facilitate the exercise of Combined Company Rights, the
Disbursing Agent will mail on or as promptly as is practicable after the
applicable Distribution Record Date to each Holder of Allowed Class MK-8
Interests as of the applicable Distribution Record Date a form of the
Exercise Notice (an "Exercise Notice") together with the Exercise
Instructions (which will include instructions for the proper completion and
due execution of the Exercise Notice and timely delivery thereof, together
with payment of the applicable exercise price for Combined Company Rights
sought to be exercised, to the Disbursing Agent and may specify other
requirements relating to the valid and effective exercise of Combined Company
Rights).  All determinations as to proper completion, due execution,
timeliness, eligibility, prorationing and other matters affecting the
validity or effectiveness of any attempted exercise of any Combined Company
Rights shall be made by the Disbursing Agent, whose determination shall be
final and binding.  The Disbursing Agent in its sole discretion may waive any
defect or irregularity, or permit a defect or irregularity to be corrected
within such time as it may determine or reject the purported exercise of any
Combined Company Right subject to any such defect or irregularity. 
Deliveries required to be received by the Disbursing Agent in connection with
a purported exercise of Combined Company Rights will not be deemed to have
been so received or accepted until actual receipt thereof by the Disbursing
Agent shall have occurred and any defects or irregularities shall have been
waived or cured within such time as the Disbursing Agent may determine in its
sole discretion.  Neither the Debtor nor the Disbursing Agent will have any
obligation to give notice to any holder of a Combined Company Right of any
defect or irregularity in connection with any purported exercise thereof or
incur any liability as a result of any failure to give any such notice.

C.   CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS, EMPLOYMENT-RELATED
AGREEMENTS AND COMPENSATION PROGRAMS

     1.   CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS

          (a)  COMBINED COMPANY/REORGANIZED MK

     As of the Effective Date, the Combined Company Certificate of
Incorporation and the Combined Company Bylaws shall be substantially in the
forms of Exhibits C and B, respectively, to the Plan.  The Combined Company

Company Common Stock (or, if the Merger Agreement is terminated, New MK
Common Stock) or MK Rail Stock, pursuant to the Plan, the Disbursing Agent
shall cause the Combined Company Common Stock (or, if the Merger Agreement
is terminated, New MK Common Stock) or MK Rail Stock held by it in its
capacity as Disbursing Agent to be: (A) represented in person or by proxy at
each meeting of the stockholders of the Combined Company (or, if the Merger
Agreement is terminated, Reorganized MK) or MK Rail, as applicable; and (B)
voted with respect to any matter of the Combined Company (or, if the Merger
Agreement is terminated, Reorganized MK) or MK Rail, as applicable, 
proportionally with the votes cast by the other stockholders of the Combined
Company (or, if the Merger Agreement is terminated, Reorganized MK) or MK
Rail, as applicable. 

          (b)  AFTER DISTRIBUTIONS BECOME DELIVERABLE

     Within 15 days after the end of each calendar month following the
calendar month in which the Effective Date occurs, the applicable Disbursing
Agent will make all distributions that become deliverable to holders of
Allowed Claims or Allowed Interests during the preceding calendar month. 
Each such distribution will include, to the extent applicable: (i) dividends
or other distributions, if any, that shall have theretofore been paid to the
Disbursing Agent in respect of any Combined Company Common Stock (or, if the
Merger Agreement is terminated, New MK Common Stock) and Combined Company
Series A Preferred Stock (or, if the Merger Agreement is terminated, New MK
Series A Preferred Stock) included in such distribution and (ii) a Pro Rata
share of the Reorganization Investment Yield from the investment of any
undeliverable cash (including dividends or other distributions on
undeliverable Combined Company Common Stock, from the date that such
distribution would have first been due had it then been deliverable to the
date that such distribution becomes deliverable).

          (c)  FAILURE TO CLAIM UNDELIVERABLE DISTRIBUTIONS

     Any Holder of an Allowed Claim or Allowed Interest that does not assert
a claim pursuant to the Plan for an undeliverable distribution within one
year after the Effective Date (or in the case of a Subsequent Equity
Recovery, within one year after the applicable distribution date) shall have
its claim for such undeliverable distribution discharged and shall be
forever barred from asserting any such claim for an undeliverable
distribution against the Reorganized Debtor or its property.  In such cases:
(i) any Cash or MK Rail Stock held for distribution on account of such
claims for undeliverable distributions shall be property of the Combined
Company (or, if the Merger Agreement is terminated, Reorganized MK) free of
any restrictions thereon; (ii) any Combined Company Common Stock (or, if the
Merger Agreement is terminated, New MK Common Stock) held for issuance on
account of such claims for undeliverable distributions shall either be
canceled or held as treasury shares as the Combined Company (or, if the
Merger Agreement is terminated, Reorganized MK) may determine is
appropriate; and (iii) any Combined Company Warrants (or, if the Merger
Agreement is terminated, New MK Warrants) and Combined Company Rights
(unless the Merger Agreement is terminated) held for issuance on account of
such claims for undeliverable distributions shall be canceled.  To the
extent that such undeliverable Cash, MK Rail Stock or Combined Company
Securities (or, if the Merger Agreement is terminated, New MK Securities)
are held by a Third-Party Disbursing Agent, the Third-Party Disbursing Agent
shall return such Cash or the securities or other instruments evidencing
such MK Rail Stock or Combined Company Securities (or, if the Merger
Agreement is terminated, New MK Securities) to the Combined Company (or, if
the Merger Agreement is terminated, Reorganized MK).  Nothing contained in
the Plan shall require the Debtor, Reorganized Debtor or any Disbursing
Agent to attempt to locate any holder of an Allowed Claim or Allowed Interest.

D.   DISTRIBUTION RECORD DATE

     As of the close of business on the Confirmation Date, the transfer
registers for the Old Common Stock maintained by the Debtor, or its agent,
shall be closed.  The Disbursing Agents and their respective agents shall
have no obligation to recognize the transfer of any Old Common Stock
occurring after the Confirmation Date or the transfer of any Claim occurring
after the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the
Effective Date, and shall be entitled for all purposes herein to recognize
and deal only with those Holders of record as of the close of business on the
Distribution Record Date.

E.   MEANS OF CASH PAYMENTS

     Cash payments made pursuant to the Plan shall be in U.S. dollars by
checks drawn on a domestic bank selected by the Disbursing Agent, or by wire
transfer from a domestic bank, at the option of the Disbursing Agent.  Cash
payments of $1,000,000.00 or more to be made pursuant to the Plan will, to
the extent requested in writing no later than five days after the
Confirmation Date, be made by wire transfer from a domestic bank.  Cash
payments to foreign creditors may be made, at the option of the Disbursing
Agent, in such funds and by such means as are necessary or customary in a
particular foreign jurisdiction.

F.   TIMING AND CALCULATION OF AMOUNTS TO BE DISTRIBUTED

     1.   IN GENERAL

     On the Effective Date, to the extent that the Plan provides for
distributions on account of Allowed Claims or Allowed Interests in the
applicable Class, each Holder of an Allowed Claim or Allowed Interest shall
receive the full amount of the distributions that the Plan provides for
Allowed Claims or Allowed Interests in the applicable Class.  Beginning on
the date that is 15 days after the end of the calendar month following the
calendar month in which the Effective Date occurs and 15 days after the end
of each calendar month thereafter distributions shall also be made, pursuant
to Sections VII.C and VIII.C below, respectively, to (a) Holders of Claims
or Interests to whom a distribution has become deliverable during the
preceding calendar month and (b) to Holders of Disputed Claims or Disputed
Interests in any such Class whose Claims or Interests were Allowed during the
preceding calendar month.  Such monthly distributions shall also be in the
full amount that the Plan provides for Allowed Claims or Allowed Interests
in the applicable Class.

     2.   DISTRIBUTIONS OF STOCK

     Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, only whole numbers of
shares of Combined Company Common Stock (or, if Merger Agreement is
terminated, New MK Common Stock), MK Rail Stock and (if the Liquidating
Trust is not established) Combined Company Series A Preferred Stock (or, if
the Merger Agreement is terminated, the New MK Series A Preferred Stock)
shall be issued or transferred, as the case may be, pursuant to the Plan. 
When any distribution on account of an Allowed Claim pursuant to the Plan
would otherwise result in the issuance or transfer of a number of shares of
Combined Company Common Stock (or, if Merger Agreement is terminated, New MK
Common Stock), MK Rail Stock or (if the Liquidating Trust is not
established) Combined Company Series A Preferred Stock (or, if the Merger
Agreement is terminated, the New MK Series A Preferred Stock) that is not a
whole number, the actual distribution of shares of such stock shall be
rounded to the next higher or lower whole number as follows: (a) fractions
of 1/2 or greater shall be rounded to the next higher whole number and (b)
fractions of less than 1/2 shall be rounded to the next lower whole number. 
The total number of shares of Combined Company Common Stock (or, if Merger
Agreement is terminated, New MK Common Stock), MK Rail Stock and (if the
Liquidating Trust is not established) Combined Company Series A Preferred
Stock (or, if the Merger Agreement is terminated, the New MK Series A
Preferred Stock) to be distributed to a Class of Claims shall be adjusted as
necessary to account for the rounding provided for in this Section VII.F.2.
No consideration shall be provided in lieu of fractional shares that are
rounded down.

     3.   DISTRIBUTIONS OF WARRANTS

     Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, only whole numbers of
Combined Company Warrants (or, if the Merger Agreement is terminated, New MK
Warrants) shall be issued pursuant to the Plan.  When any distribution on
account of an Allowed Class MK-8 Interest pursuant to the Plan would
otherwise result in the issuance of a number of Combined Company Warrants
(or, if the Merger Agreement is terminated, New MK Warrants) that is not a
whole number, the actual distribution of such Combined Company Warrants (or,
if the Merger Agreement is terminated, New MK Warrants) shall be rounded to
the next higher or lower whole number as follows (a) fractions of 1/2 or
greater shall be rounded to the next higher whole number and (b) fractions
of less than 1/2 shall be rounded to the next lower whole number.  The total
number of Combined Company Warrants (or, if the Merger Agreement is
terminated, New MK Warrants) to be distributed to a Holder of an Allowed
Class MK-8 Interest shall be adjusted as necessary to account for the
rounding provided for in this Section VII.F.3.  No consideration shall be
provided in lieu of fractional warrants that are rounded down.

     4.   DISTRIBUTIONS OF RIGHTS

     On the Effective Date, the Rights shall be distributed to Holders of
Allowed Class MK-8 Interests in accordance with Sections III.B.8 and V.B.6.

     5.   COMPLIANCE WITH TAX REGULATIONS

          (a)  In connection with the Plan, to the extent applicable, the
Disbursing Agent shall comply with all tax withholding and reporting
requirements imposed on it by any governmental unit, and all distributions
pursuant to the Plan shall be subject to such withholding and reporting
requirements.  The Disbursing Agent shall be authorized to take any and all
actions that may be necessary or appropriate to comply with such withholding
and reporting requirements.

          (b)  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan: (i) each
Holder of an Allowed Claim or Interest that is to receive a distribution of
Cash, MK Rail Stock or Combined Company Securities (or, if the Merger
Agreement is terminated, New MK Securities) pursuant to the Plan (including
pursuant to the exercise of Combined Company Rights) shall have sole and
exclusive responsibility for the satisfaction and payment of any tax
obligations imposed by any governmental unit, including income, withholding
and other tax obligations, on account of such distribution; and (ii) no
distribution shall be made to or on behalf of such Holder pursuant to the
Plan (or to any successor in interest thereto) unless and until such Holder
(or such successor in interest, if any) has made arrangements satisfactory
to the Disbursing Agent for the payment and satisfaction of such tax
obligations.  Any Cash, MK Rail Stock or Combined Company Securities (or, if
the Merger Agreement is terminated, New MK Securities) to be distributed
pursuant to the Plan shall, pending the implementation of such arrangements,
be treated as an undeliverable distribution pursuant to Section VII.C.2
above.

G.   SETOFFS

     Except with respect to claims of a Debtor or Reorganized Debtor released
pursuant to the Plan or any contract, instrument, release, indenture, or
other agreement or document created in connection with the Plan, the Debtor
or Reorganized Debtor may, pursuant to section 553 of the Bankruptcy Code or
applicable nonbankruptcy law, set off against any Allowed Claim (other than
a Funded Debt Claim, a Metra Lender Claim, a Transit Bonding,  Claim or a
Boise Landlord Claim) and the distributions to be made pursuant to the Plan
on account of such Claim (before any distribution is made on account of such
Claim), the claims, rights and causes of action of any nature that the Debtor
or Reorganized Debtor may hold against the Holder of such Allowed Claim;
provided, however, that neither the failure to effect such a setoff nor the
allowance of any Claim hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release by the
Debtor or Reorganized Debtor of any such claims, rights and causes of action
that the Debtor or Reorganized Debtor may possess against such Holder.

H.   SURRENDER OF CANCELLED DEBT INSTRUMENTS OR SECURITIES

     As a condition precedent to receiving any distribution pursuant to the
Plan on account of an Allowed Claim or Allowed Interest evidenced by the
instruments, securities or other documentation cancelled pursuant to Section
V.B.1  above,  other  than  distribution  of  the  Combined  Company  Rights-
to-Holders of Allowed Class MK-8 Interests, the Holder of such Claim or
Interest shall tender the applicable instruments, securities or other
documentation evidencing such Claim or Interest to the Disbursing Agent
pursuant to a letter of transmittal furnished by the Disbursing Agent.  Any
Cash, MK Rail Stock or Combined Company Securities (or, if the Merger
Agreement is terminated, New MK Securities) to be distributed pursuant to the
Plan on account of any such Claim or Interest shall, pending such surrender,
be treated as an undeliverable distribution pursuant to Section VII.C.2
above.  For purposes of this Section VII.H, references to delivery of
Existing Loan Documents shall be deemed to refer only to copies of documents
evidencing that such creditor is a Holder of such Funded Debt Claim which may
be accomplished through a Stipulation of Amount and of Nature of Claim.

     1.   EXISTING LOAN DOCUMENTS AND CAPITAL STOCK CERTIFICATES

     Except as provided in Section VII.H.2 below for lost, stolen, mutilated
or destroyed Existing Loan Documents or Capital Stock certificates, each
Holder of an Allowed Claim or Allowed Interest evidenced by an Existing Loan
Document or Capital Stock certificate shall tender such Existing Loan
Document or Capital Stock certificate to the Disbursing Agent in accordance
with written instructions to be provided in a letter of transmittal to such
Holders by the Disbursing Agent as promptly as practicable following the
Effective Date.  Such letter of transmittal shall specify that delivery of
such Existing Loan Documents or Capital Stock certificates will be effected,
and risk of loss and title thereto will pass, only upon the proper delivery
of such Existing Loan Documents or Capital Stock certificates with the letter
of transmittal in accordance with such instructions.  Such letter of
transmittal shall also include, among other provisions, customary provisions
with respect to the authority of the holder of the applicable Existing Loan
Document or Capital Stock certificate to act and the authenticity of any
signatures required on the letter of transmittal.  All surrendered Existing
Loan Documents and Capital Stock certificates shall be marked as canceled and
delivered to the Combined Company (or, if the Merger Agreement is terminated
Reorganized MK).

     2.   LOST, STOLEN, MUTILATED OR DESTROYED EXISTING LOAN DOCUMENTS OR
CAPITAL STOCK CERTIFICATES

     In addition to any requirements under the applicable certificate or
articles of incorporation or bylaws of the Debtor, any Holder of a Claim or
an Interest evidenced by an Existing Loan Document or a Capital Stock
certificate that has been lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed shall, in
lieu of surrendering such Existing Loan Document or Capital Stock
certificate, deliver to the Disbursing Agent:  (a) evidence satisfactory to
the Disbursing Agent of the loss, theft, mutilation or destruction; and (b)
such security or indemnity as may be required by the Disbursing Agent to
hold the Disbursing Agent harmless from any damages, liabilities or costs
incurred in treating such individual as a Holder of an Existing Loan
Document or a Capital Stock certificate.  Upon compliance with this Section
VII.H.2 by a Holder of a Claim or an Interest evidenced by an Existing Loan
Document or Capital Stock certificate, such Holder shall, for all purposes
under the Plan, be deemed to have surrendered an Existing Loan Document or a
Capital Stock certificate, as applicable.

     3.   FAILURE TO SURRENDER CANCELED EXISTING LOAN DOCUMENTS OR CAPITAL
STOCK CERTIFICATES

     Any Holder of an Existing Loan Document or Capital Stock certificate
that fails to surrender or be deemed to have surrendered such Existing Loan
Document or Capital Stock certificate within one year after the Effective
Date shall have its claim for a distribution pursuant to the Plan on account
of such Existing Loan Document or Capital Stock certificate discharged and
shall be forever barred from asserting any such claim against the Reorganized
Debtor or its property.  In such cases, any Cash, MK Rail Stock or Combined
Company Securities (or, if the Merger Agreement is terminated, New MK
Securities) held for distribution on account of such Claim shall be disposed
of pursuant to the provisions set forth in Section VII.C.2 above.

I.   RESTRICTIONS RELATED TO MK RAIL STOCK

     Each recipient of MK Rail Stock under the Plan shall be deemed to be
bound by the MK Rail Stockholder Agreement, whether or not such recipient
executed such agreement and shall not be permitted to transfer such MK Rail
Stock except pursuant to the terms of the MK Rail Stockholders Agreement.

J.   PLEDGE BY HOLDER OF BOISE LANDLORD CLAIMS OF ENTITLEMENT TO RECEIVE
DISTRIBUTIONS

     Upon written notice from the Holder of the Boise Landlord Claims, such
Holder may pledge and assign all or any portion of its right to receive
distributions of Combined Company Common Stock (or, if the Merger Agreement
is terminated, New MK Common Stock) and (unless the Merger Agreement is
terminated) Boise Landlord Cash Distribution in respect of the Boise Landlord
Claims and its rights as a beneficiary of the Liquidating  Trust, such notice
to be irrevocable unless such revocation shall be joined in by the pledgee
or assignee.  Any such pledge or assignment shall be binding upon the Debtor
and shall be effective for all our purposes of this Plan.


                                ARTICLE VIII.

                PROCEDURES FOR RESOLVING DISPUTED CLAIMS AND 
                              DISPUTED INTERESTS

A.   PROSECUTION OF OBJECTIONS TO CLAIMS AND INTERESTS

     After the Confirmation Date, only the Debtor and Reorganized Debtor
shall have the authority to File objections, settle, compromise, withdraw or
litigate to judgment objections to Claims and Interests.  Except with respect
to the Metra Lender Claims, from and after the Confirmation Date, the Debtor
and Reorganized Debtor may settle or compromise any Disputed Claim or
Disputed Interest without approval of the Bankruptcy Court.

B.   TREATMENT OF DISPUTED CLAIMS OR INTERESTS

     1.   NO PAYMENTS ON ACCOUNT OF DISPUTED CLAIMS OR INTERESTS

     Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, no payments or
distributions shall be made on account of a Disputed Claim or a Disputed
Interest until such Claim or Interest becomes an Allowed Claim or Allowed
Interest.  Prior to the Petition Date, the Debtor delivered Stipulations of
Amount and Nature of Claim to the Holders of the Funded Debt Claims, the
Boise Landlord Claims and the Transit Bonding Claims.  Such Claims shall be
treated as Allowed Claims as of the Petition Due in the amounts set forth in
such Stipulations of Amount and nature of Claim and shall not be treated as
Disputed Claims.

     2.   RESOLUTION OR ESTIMATION OF CLAIMS

     The Debtor or the Reorganized Debtor may, at any time, request that the
Bankruptcy Court estimate any contingent or unliquidated Claim pursuant to
section 502(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, irrespective of whether the Debtor or
Reorganized Debtor has previously objected to such Claim or whether the
Bankruptcy Court has ruled on any such objection.  The Bankruptcy Court will
retain jurisdiction to estimate any contingent or unliquidated Claim at any
time during litigation concerning any objection to the Claim, including
during the pendency of any appeal relating to any such objection.  If the
Bankruptcy Court estimates any contingent or unliquidated Claim, that
estimated amount will constitute either the Allowed Amount of such Claim or
a maximum limitation on such Claim, as determined by the Bankruptcy Court. 
If the estimated amount constitutes a maximum limitation on such Claim, the
Debtor or Reorganized Debtor may elect to pursue any supplemental proceedings
to object to any ultimate payment on account of such Claim.  All of these
Claims objection, estimation and resolution procedures are cumulative and not
necessarily exclusive of one another.  In addition to seeking estimation of
Claims as provided in this Section VIII.B.2, the Debtor or Reorganized Debtor
may resolve or adjudicate any Disputed Claim in the manner in which the
amount of such Claim and the rights of the Holder of such Claim would have
been resolved or adjudicated if the Chapter 11 Case had not been commenced. 
Claims may be subsequently compromised, settled, withdrawn or resolved by the
Debtor or Reorganized Debtor pursuant to Section VIII.A above.

C.   DISTRIBUTIONS ON ACCOUNT OF DISPUTED CLAIMS OR INTERESTS ONCE THEY ARE
ALLOWED

     Within 15 days after the end of each calendar month following the
calendar month in which the Effective Date occurs, the applicable Disbursing
Agent shall make all distributions on account of any Disputed Claim or
Disputed Interest that has become an Allowed Claim or Allowed Interest during
the preceding calendar month.  Such distributions shall be made pursuant to
the provisions of the Plan governing the applicable Class.  Holders of
Disputed Claims or Disputed Interests that are ultimately allowed shall also
be entitled to receive, on the basis of the amount ultimately allowed: (1)
matured and payable interest, if any, at the rate provided for the Class to
which such Claim belongs; (2) any dividends or other payments made on account
of Combined Company Common Stock (or, if the Merger Agreement is terminated,
New MK Common Stock) held pending distribution; and (3) a Pro Rata share of
the Reorganization Investment Yield from the investment of any Cash held
pending distribution from the date such amounts would have been due had such
Claim or Interest then been allowed to the end of the calendar month when
such Claim or Interest was allowed.


                                 ARTICLE IX.

                   CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO CONFIRMATION AND
                           CONSUMMATION OF THE PLAN

A.   CONDITIONS TO CONFIRMATION

     The Confirmation Order shall be in form and substance satisfactory to
the Debtor and (unless the Merger Agreement is terminated) Washington, and
the Confirmation Order shall expressly authorize and direct the Debtor and
Reorganized Debtor to perform those actions specified in Sections III.B.3,
B.4, B.6 and B.8, V.C, C.E, V.F, V.G, VII.F and XI.D of the Plan.

B.   CONDITIONS TO EFFECTIVE DATE

     The Plan shall not be consummated and the Effective Date shall not occur
unless and until each of the  following conditions has been satisfied or duly
waived (if available) pursuant to Section IX.C below: 

          1.   The Confirmation Order shall authorize and direct the Debtor
and Reorganized Debtor to take all actions necessary or appropriate to enter
into, implement and consummate the contracts, instruments, releases, leases,
indentures and other agreements or documents created in connection with the
Plan  or  the Restructuring,  including  those  actions  contemplated by  the
provisions of the  Plan set forth  in Section IX.A  above.  The  Confirmation
Order shall not be subject to a presently effective stay pending appeal.

          2.   All borrowings under the DIP Financing Facility have been paid
in full in Cash and all commitments terminated thereunder.

          3.   If the Merger Agreement has been terminated, the lenders under
the New Credit Facility shall be obligated to fund the New Credit Facility
on terms acceptable to the Debtor.

          4.   Final Orders have been entered approving the Derivative Action
Settlements.

          5.   The conditions to effectiveness of the New Lease have been
satisfied.

          6.   MK Rail shall have redeemed the MK Rail Rights or the Debtor
shall be satisfied, by reason of an amendment to the MK Rail Rights Plan, a
judicial determination or otherwise, that the MK Rail Rights are inapplicable
to the transactions contemplated by the Plan.

          7.   Either MK Rail shall have completed the repurchase of the
entire MK Rail Note or the  MK Rail Note Cancellation Agreement shall have
been terminated in accordance with its terms.

C.   WAIVER OF CONDITIONS

     The conditions to Confirmation and the Effective Date, other than the
condition set forth above in Section IX.B.I, B.2 and B.7, may be waived in
whole or in part by the Debtor and (unless the Merger Agreement is
terminated), Washington at any time, without notice, an order of the
Bankruptcy Court or any further action other than proceeding to Confirmation
and consummation of the Plan.  The failure to satisfy or waive any condition
may be asserted by the Debtor and (unless the Merger Agreement is terminated)
Washington regardless of the circumstances giving rise to the failure of such
condition to be satisfied (including any action or inaction by the Debtor or
Washington).  The failure of the Debtor and (unless the Merger Agreement is
terminated) Washington to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be
deemed a waiver of any other rights and each such right shall be deemed an
ongoing right that may be asserted at any time.

D.   EFFECT OF NONOCCURRENCE OF CONDITIONS TO EFFECTIVE DATE

     Each of the conditions to consummation and the Effective Date must be
satisfied or duly waived, as provided above, within 30 days after the
Confirmation Date unless the Debtor extends this time for a period not
exceeding 90 days.  If each condition to the Effective Date has not been
satisfied or duly waived pursuant to Section IX.C above, within 90 days after
the Confirmation Date, then upon motion by any party in interest made before
the time that each of such conditions has been satisfied or duly waived and
upon notice to such parties in interest as the Bankruptcy Court may direct,
the Confirmation Order shall be vacated by the Bankruptcy Court; provided,
however, that, notwithstanding the filing of such motion, the Confirmation
Order may not be vacated if each of the conditions to the Effective Date is
either satisfied or duly waived before the Bankruptcy Court enters an order
granting such motion.  If the Confirmation Order is vacated pursuant to this
Section IX.D, the Plan shall be deemed null and void in all respects,
including the discharge of Claims and termination of Interests pursuant to
section 1141 of the Bankruptcy Code and the assumptions or rejections of
executory contracts and unexpired leases pursuant to Sections VI.A and VI.B
above, and nothing contained in the Plan shall (1) constitute a waiver or
release of any Claims by or against, or any Interests in, the Debtor or (2)
prejudice in any manner the rights of the Debtor.


                                  ARTICLE X.

                                   CRAMDOWN

     The Debtor hereby requests Confirmation of the Plan under section
1129(b) of the Bankruptcy Code if any Impaired Class does not accept the Plan
in accordance with section 1126 of the Bankruptcy Code.  Subject to the
Merger Agreement, the Debtor reserves the right to modify the Plan to the
extent, if any, that Confirmation pursuant to section 1129(b) of the
Bankruptcy Code requires modification.


                                 ARTICLE XI.

                     DISCHARGE OF CLAIMS, TERMINATION OF
               INTERESTS, INJUNCTIONS AND SUBORDINATION RIGHTS

A.   DISCHARGE OF CLAIMS AND TERMINATION OF INTERESTS

     1.   Except as provided in the Plan or the Confirmation Order, the
rights afforded under the Plan and the treatment of Claims and Interests
under the Plan shall be in exchange for and in complete satisfaction,
discharge and release of all Claims and termination of all Interests,
including any interest accrued on Claims from the Petition Date.  Except as
provided in the Plan or the Confirmation Order, Confirmation shall:  (a)
discharge the Debtor from all Claims or other debts that arose before the
Confirmation Date and all debts of the kind specified in section 502(g),
502(h) or 502(i) of the Bankruptcy Code, whether or not (i) a proof of Claim
based on such debt is Filed or deemed Filed pursuant to section 501 of the
Bankruptcy Code, (ii) a Claim based on such debt is Allowed pursuant to
section 502 of the Bankruptcy Code or (iii) the Holder of a Claim based on
such debt has accepted the Plan; and (b) terminate all Interests and other
rights of equity security holders in the Debtor.

     2.   As of the Confirmation Date, except as provided in the Plan or the
Confirmation Order, all entities shall be precluded from asserting against
the Debtor, Reorganized Debtor, Plan Participants, their successors or their
property, any other or further claims, debts, rights, causes of action,
liabilities or equity interests relating to the Debtor based upon any act,
omission transaction or other activity of any nature that occurred prior to
the Confirmation Date.  In accordance with the foregoing, except as provided
in the Plan or the Confirmation Order, the Confirmation Order shall be a
judicial determination of discharge of all such Claims and other debts and
liabilities against the Debtor and termination of all such Interests and
other rights of equity security holders in the Debtor, pursuant to sections
524 and 1141 of the Bankruptcy Code, and such discharge shall void any
judgment obtained against the Debtor at any time, to the extent that such
judgment relates to a discharged Claim or terminated Interest.

     3.   Nothing in this Plan will restrict any federal government
regulatory agency from pursuing any regulatory or police enforcement action
against the Debtor, the Reorganized Debtor, their current or former officers,
directors or employees, and their respective agents, advisors, attorneys and
representatives acting in any capacity, other than any action or proceeding
of any type to recover monetary claims, damages or penalties against the
Debtor for an act or omission occurring prior to Confirmation.

B.   INJUNCTIONS

     1.   INJUNCTION RELATED TO DISCHARGED CLAIMS AND TERMINATED INTERESTS

     Except as provided in the Plan or the Confirmation Order, as of the
Confirmation Date, all entities that have held, currently hold or may hold a
Claim or other debt or liability that is discharged or an Interest or other
right of an equity security holder that is terminated pursuant to the terms
of the Plan are permanently enjoined from taking any of the following
actions as against the Debtor, Reorganized Debtor or its property on account
of any such discharged Claims, debts or liabilities or terminated Interests
or rights: (a) commencing or continuing, in any manner or in any place, any
action or other proceeding; (b) enforcing, attaching, collecting or
recovering in any manner any judgment, award, deem or order; (c) creating,

continuing, in any manner or in any place, any action that does not comply
with or is inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan.

     2.   RELEASED CLAIMS

     As of the Effective Date, all entities that have held, currently hold
or may hold a claim, demand, debt, right, cause of action or liability that
is released pursuant to Section V.E are permanently enjoined from taking any
of the following actions on account of such released claims, demands, debts,
rights, causes of action or liabilities: (a) commencing or continuing in any
manner any action or other proceeding; (b) enforcing, attaching, collecting

continuing any action, in any manner, in any place that does not comply with
or is inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan.

     3.   CONSENT OF INJUNCTION

     By accepting distributions pursuant to the Plan, each holder of an
Allowed Claim or Allowed Interest receiving distributions pursuant to the
Plan will be deemed to have specifically consented to the injunctions set
forth in this Section XI.B.

     4.   REGULATORY OR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS

     Nothing in this Plan will restrict any federal government regulatory

Holders with respect to any distribution made pursuant to the Plan.  On the

that a Holder of a Claim or Interest may have with respect to any
distribution to be made pursuant to the Plan (other than pursuant to the
Metra Credit Agreement as to the Metra Lenders) shall be discharged and
terminated, and all actions related to the enforcement of such subordination
rights shall be permanently enjoined.  Accordingly, distributions pursuant

of such terminated subordination rights.

legal and equitable subordination rights that a Holder of a Claim or an
Interest may have with respect to any Allowed Claim or Allowed Interest, or
any distribution to be made on account of an Allowed Claim or Allowed
Interest.  The entry of the Confirmation Order shall constitute the
Bankruptcy Court's approval of the compromise or settlement of all such
claims or controversies and the Bankruptcy Court's finding that such
compromise or settlement is in the best interests of the Debtor, Reorganized
Debtor and its property and Claim and Interest Holders, and is fair,
equitable and reasonable.

STATEMENT AND RELATED DOCUMENT AND RELATED INDEMNITY

     1.   The Plan Participants, the Lender Steering Committee and the
Unofficial Equity Committee and their professionals shall neither have nor

Claim or Interest, for any act taken or omitted to be taken in connection
with or related to the formulation, preparation, dissemination,
implementation, Confirmation or consummation of the Plan, the Disclosure
Statement, the Confirmation Order or any contract, instrument, release or
other agreement or document created or entered into, or any other act taken
or omitted to be taken in connection with the Plan, the Disclosure Statement
or the Confirmation Order, including solicitation of acceptances of the Plan.

     2.   The Combined Company (or, if the Merger Agreement is terminated,
Reorganized MK) shall indemnify each Plan Participant, hold each Plan
Participant harmless from, and reimburse each Plan Participant for, any and
all losses, costs, expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses),
liabilities and damages sustained by a Plan Participant arising from any

provision shall then be applicable as altered or interpreted. 
Notwithstanding any such holding, alteration or interpretation, the remainder
of the terms and provisions of the Plan will remain in full force and effect
and will in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated by such holding,
alteration or interpretation.  The Confirmation Order shall constitute a
judicial determination and shall provide that each term and provision of the
Plan, as it may have been altered or interpreted in accordance with the
foregoing, is valid and enforceable pursuant to its terms.

                         ----------------------------------------

          2.1. (i) At any time during the period commencing on the date of
the first filing by the Company of its Annual Report on Form 10-K that
follows the effective date of the Plan and ending on the fifth anniversary
thereof, one or more Holders of Registrable Securities may at their option
make a written request (a "Demand Registration Request") to the Company (the
"Demanding Holder") requesting that the Company file with the Commission a
registration statement on an appropriate form under the Securities Act (a
"Demand Registration Statement") to register (subject to Section 2.6) all or
                                                         -----------
such number of such Demanding Holder's Registrable Securities as the
Demanding Holder shall request in writing; provided, however, that no request
                                           --------  -------
may be made pursuant to this Section 2.1 if (A) within twelve months prior
                             -----------
to the date of such request a Demand Registration Statement pursuant to this
Section 2.1 shall have ben declared effective by the Commission or (B) the
- - -----------
Registrable Securities that the Demanding Holders request be included in the
Demand Registration Statement do not have a Market Value as of the date the
request is given to the Company of at least $5,000,000.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall a Demand Registration Request be effective
unless and until the Registrable Securities that the Demanding Holders
request be included in the Demand Registration and that other Holders request
be included in the Demand Registration pursuant to Section 2.1(iii) hereof
have an aggregate Market Value determined as of the day the last such request
is received of at least $20,000,000.  After an effective Demand Registration
Request is made, the Company shall file with the Commission the Demand
Registration Statement.  Any Demand Registration Statement shall relate to
an underwritten offering (whether on a "firm," "best efforts" or "all
reasonable efforts" basis or otherwise) or an agented offering.  Any Demand
Registration Request made pursuant to this Section 2.1 shall be addressed to
                                           -----------
the attention of the Secretary of the Company and shall specify the number
of Registrable Securities to be registered, the intended methods of
disposition thereof and that the request is for a Demand Registration
Statement pursuant to this Section 2.1.
                           -----------

      (ii)     The Company shall be entitled to postpone for up to 120 days
the filing of any Demand Registration Statement otherwise required to be
prepared and filed pursuant to this Section 2.1 if (A) the Board of Directors
                                    -----------
of the company determines, in its good faith reasonable judgment, that such
registration and the Transfer of Registrable Securities contemplated thereby
would materially interfere with, or require the premature disclosure of, any
financing, acquisition or reorganization involving the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or would otherwise require the premature disclosure of any other
material nonpublic information as to which the Company has a bona fide
business purpose for maintaining its confidentiality and (B) the Company
promptly gives the Demanding Holders notice of such determination (which
notice need not disclose the fact, event or information); provided, however,
                                                          --------  -------
that the Company shall not have, within the twelve months prior to the date
of the postponement, postponed pursuant to this Section 2.1(ii) the filing
                                                ---------------
of any other Demand Registration Statement that was subsequently abandoned
because the Demand Registration Request relating thereto was withdrawn.

     (iii)     Whenever the Company receives a demand pursuant to Section
                                                                  -------
2.1(i) to effect the registration of any Registrable Securities, the Company
- - ------
shall promptly give written notice of such proposed registration to all
Holders.  Any such Holder may, within thirty days after receipt of such
notice, request in writing that all of such Holder's Registrable Securities,
or any portion thereof designated by such Holder, be included in the
registration.

          2.2.  As soon as practicable after the later of (i) the entry by
the Bankruptcy Court of the order approving the assumption of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) July 1, 1996, the Company
shall file with the Commission a registration statement on Form S-3 in
accordance with the Securities Act for an offering on a delayed or continuous
basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act (the "Shelf Registration
Statement").  The Company shall use its reasonable best effort to have the
Shelf Registration Statement declared effective on the effective date of the
Plan.  Subject to compliance with the provisions of Section 5, the Holders
                                                    ---------
shall be entitled to have all or a portion of such Holders' Registrable
Securities included in Shelf Registration Statement.

          2.3.  The Company shall be obligated to effect no more than four
Demand Registration Statements pursuant to this Agreement.  For purposes of
the preceding sentence, a Demand Registration Statement shall not be deemed
to have been effected (i) unless a registration statement with respect
thereto has become effective, (ii) if after such registration statement has
become effective, such registration or the related offer, sale or
distribution of Registrable Securities thereunder is interfered with by any
stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the Commission or
other governmental agency or court for any reason not attributable to any of
the Selling Holders and such interference is not thereafter eliminated, or
(iii) if the conditions to closing specified in any underwriting agreement
containing usual and customary terms entered into in connection with such
registration are not satisfied or waived, other than by reason of failure on
the part of any of the Selling Holders.  The Company's obligation to effect
a given Demand Registration pursuant to Section 2.1 shall be deemed to have
                                        -----------
been satisfied upon the earlier of (x) the date as of which all the
Receivable Securities included therein shall have been disposed of pursuant
to the Demand Registration Statement, and (y)  the date as of which such
Demand Registration Statement shall have been Continuously Effective for a
period of 90 days.

          2.4.  Whenever the Company receives request for a Demand
Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2.1, the Company shall have the
                                   -----------
right to register in any such Demand Registration Statement and to include
in any related offering shares of authorized by unissued Common Stock.  The
Company may exercise the foregoing option to include additional shares by
written notice delivered to each of the Selling Holders within 30 days
following the Company's receipt of the request for a Demand Registration
Statement pursuant to Section 2.1(i).
                      --------------

          2.5.  In any Demand Registration Statement, the managing or lead
underwriter or underwriters (of an underwritten offering) or the lead agent
(for an agented offering) shall be a nationally recognized firm 
selected by the Majority Selling Holders with the approval of the Company,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

          2.6.  Whenever the Company effects a Demand Registration Statement
pursuant to Section 2.1, if the Underwriters' Representative or Agent advises
            -----------
the Company and each Selling Holder in writing that, in its opinion, the
amount of securities requested to be included in such offering (whether by
the Company or the Selling Holders) exceeds the amount which can be sold in
such offering within a price range acceptable to the Majority Selling
Holders, the securities to be included in such offering and the related
registration shall be reduced in the following order to an amount which can
be sold within such price range:  first, the amount of securities, if any,
that the Company has requested be included in the offering and registration
shall be reduced until no such securities are included therein; and second,
the amount of Registrable Securities that the Selling Holders have requested
be included in the offering and registration shall be reduced on a pro rata
basis among all Selling Holders based on the relative number of securities
each has requested be included in such offering.

          2.7.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
neither MK nor MKO shall have the right to dispose of any Registrable
Securities pursuant to any registration statement effected pursuant to
Section 2 or 3.

                         ---------------------------------

          3.1.  If at any time the Company proposes to register (including
for this purpose a registration effected by the Company for stockholders of
the Company other than the Holders) equity securities or securities
convertible or exchangeable into equity securities under the Securities Act
in connection with a public offering solely for cash (other than by a
registration on Form S-4 or S-8 or any successor or similar forms or filed
in connection with an exchange offer or any offering of securities solely to
the Company's existing stockholders or otherwise pursuant to a dividend
reinvestment plan or a dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan, and
other than pursuant to Section 2), the Company shall promptly give each
Holder of Registrable Securities written notice of such registration (a
"Piggyback Registration Statement").  Upon the written request of each Holder
given within fifteen days following the date of such notice, the Company
shall cause to be included in such registration statement and use its
reasonable best efforts to be registered under the Securities act all the
Registrable Securities that each such Holder shall have requested to be
registered; provided, however, that such right of inclusion shall not apply
            --------  -------
to any registration statement covering an underwritten offering of
convertible or exchangeable securities or equity securities other than Common
Stock if the Underwriters' Representative or Agent shall advise the Company
in writing (with a copy to each Selling Holder) that in its opinion, the kind
of Registrable Securities requested to be included in the Piggyback
Registration Statement would adversely affect the offering of the convertible
or exchangeable securities or equity securities or the timing thereof.  The
Company shall have the absolute right at any time to withdraw or cease to
prepare or file any registration statement for any offering referred to in
this Section 3 without any obligation or liability to any Holder.
     ---------

          3.2.  If the Underwriters' Representative or Agent shall advise the
Company in writing (with a copy to each Selling Holder) that, in its opinion,
the amount of securities requested to be included in such offering (whether
by the Company, the Selling Holders or other selling stockholders) exceeds
the amount which can be sold in such offering within a price range acceptable
to the Company, the securities to be included in such offering and the
related registration shall be reduced in the following order to amount which
can be sold within such price range:  first the amount of securities to be
included in the offering and registration by any selling stockholder other
than the Selling Holders shall be reduced until no such securities are
included therein; second, the amount of Registrable Securities that the
Selling Holders have requested be included in the offering and registration
shall be reduced on a pro rata basis among all Selling Holders based on the
relative number of securities each has requested be included in such
offering; and third, the amount of securities to be included in the offering
and registration by the Company shall be reduced.

          3.3.  During the term of this Agreement, each Holder shall be
entitled to have its Registrable Securities included in an unlimited number
of Piggyback Registration Statements pursuant to this Section 3.
                                                      ---------

          3.4.  If the Company has previously filed a registration statement
                               ---
with respect to Registerable Securities pursuant to Section 2.1 or pursuant
                                                    -----------
to this Section 3, and if such previous registration statement has not been
        ---------
withdrawn or abandoned, the Company will not file or cause to be effected any
other registration of any of its equity securities or securities convertible
or exchangeable into or exercisable for its equity securities under the
Securities Act (except on Form S-8 or any successor form),whether on its own
behalf or at the request of any holder or holders of such securities, until
a period of 180 days has elapsed from the effective date of such a previous
registration statement.

          Section 4.     Registration Procedures.  Whenever required under
                         -----------------------
Section 2 or Section 3 to effect the registration of any Registrable
- - ---------    ---------
Securities, the Company shall, as expeditiously as practicable:

          4.1.  Prepare and file with the Commission a registration statement
with respect to such Registrable Securities, subject to Subject 2.2, and use
                                                        -----------
the Company's reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement
to become effective, in each instance giving due regard to the need to
prepare current financial statements, conduct due diligence and complete
other actions that are reasonably necessary to effect a registered public
offering; provided, however, that before filing a registration statement or
          --------  -------
prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto, including documents
incorporated by reference after the initial filing of the registration
statement and prior to effectiveness thereof, the Company shall use its
reasonable efforts to furnish to one firm of legal counsel for the Selling
Holders (selected by the Majority Selling Holders) copies of all such
documents in the form substantially as proposed to be filed with the
Commission at least five business days prior to filing for review and comment
by such counsel.

          4.2.  (i)  Use the Company's reasonable best efforts to keep the
relevant registration statement Continuously Effective (x) if a Demand
Registration Statement, for up to 90 days or until such earlier date as of
which all the Registrable Securities under the Demand Registration Statement
shall have been disposed of in the manner described in the Demand
Registration Statement, and (y) if a Shelf Registration Statement, subject
to the immediately following sentence, for three years.  As soon as
reasonably practicable after the occurrence of any fact or event that makes
untrue any statement of a material fact made in the Shelf Registration
Statement or that requires the making of any additions to or changes in the
Shelf Registration Statement in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, the
Company shall prepare and file a supplement or amendment to the Shelf
Registration Statement or related prospectus, or a document incorporated
therein by reference, so that such Shelf Registration Statement and related
prospectus shall not contain any such untrue statement of a material fact or
any such omission of a material fact; provided, however, that if the Board
                                      --------  -------
of Directors of the company determines, in its good faith reasonable
judgment, that the Transfer of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf
Registration Statement would materially interfere with, or require the
premature disclosure of, any financing, acquisition or reorganization
involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries or otherwise would require
premature disclosure of any other material nonpublic information as to which
the Company has a bona fide business purpose for maintaining its
confidentiality, then for so long as such circumstances or such business
purpose continues to exist (provided that the number of days of any such
                            --------
suspension may not exceed an aggregate of 120 days in any calendar year), the
Company shall not be required to prepare or file any such supplement,
amendment or document.

      (ii)     Each Holder agrees by acquisition of a Registrable Security
that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the existence of any
fact or event of the kind described in Section 2.1(ii) or 4.2(i) (which
                                       ---------------    ------
notice need not disclose the fact, event or information), such Holder will
forthwith discontinue the disposition of any Registrable Securities pursuant
to the Shelf Registration Statement until such Holder's receipt of the copies
of a supplemented or amended prospectus as contemplated by Section 4.2(i),
                                                           --------------
or until it is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the
prospectus related to the Shelf Registration Statement may be resumed, and,
has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings that are
incorporated by reference in such prospectus.  If so directed by the Company,
each Holder will deliver to the Company all copies, other than permanent file
copies then in such Holder's possession, of the prospectus covering such
Registrable Securities that was current at the time of receipt of such
notice.

     (iii)     Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, in the case of a Demand
Registration Statement, the filing of a registration statement is postponed
as permitted by Section 2.1(ii), or, in the case of a Shelf Registration
                ---------------
Statement, the preparation and filing of a supplement, amendment or
incorporated document is postponed as permitted by Section 4.2(i) or Section
                                                   --------------
4.2(ii), the five-year period for filing a Demand Registration Statement or
the three-year period of effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement,

                           --------------
such amendments,supplements or incorporated documents to such registration
statement and the prospectus used in connection with such registration
statement as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of the Securities
Act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such
registration statement.  If the registration statement is for an underwritten
offering, the Company shall amend the registration statement or supplement
the prospectus whenever required by the terms of the underwriting agreement
entered into pursuant to Section 4.6.  In the event that any Registrable
                         -----------
Securities included in a registration statement subject to, or required by,
this Agreement remain unsold at the end of the period during which the
Company is obligated to use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of  such registration statement,  the Company may file  a post-
effective amendment to the registration statement for the purpose of removing
such securities from registered status.

          4.4.  Furnish to each Selling Holder of Registrable Securities
copies of the registration statement, any pre-effective or post-effective
amendment thereto, the prospectus, including each preliminary prospectus and
any amendments or supplements thereto, in each case in conformity with the
requirements of the Securities Act.

qualify the securities covered by such registration statement under the
securities or Blue Sky laws of such states or jurisdictions as shall be
reasonably requested by the Underwriters' Representative or Agent (as
applicable, or if inapplicable, the Majority Selling Holders), and (ii) to
obtain the withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of a
registration statement, or the lifting of any suspension of the qualification
(or exemption from qualification) of the offer and transfer of any of the
Registrable Securities in any jurisdiction, at the earliest practicable
moment; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required in
        --------  -------
connection therewith or as a condition thereto to qualify to do business,
subject itself to taxation or to file a general consent to service of process
in any states or jurisdictions where it is not now so subject.

          4.6.  In the event of Demand Registration Statement, enter into and
perform the Company's obligations under an underwriting or agency agreement
(including indemnification and contribution obligations of underwriters or
agents), in usual and customary form, with the managing underwriter or
underwriters of or agents for such offering.  The Company shall also
cooperate with the majority Selling Holders and the Underwriters'
Representative or Agent for such offering in the marketing of the Registrable
Securities, including making reasonably available the Company's officers,
accountants, counsel, premises, books and records for such purpose.

          4.7.  Promptly notify each Selling Holder of any stop order issued
or threatened to be issued by the Commission in connection therewith (and
take all reasonable actions required to prevent the entry of such stop order
or to remove it if entered).

          4.8.  Make generally available to the Company's security holders
an earnings statement satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a) of the
Securities Act no later than 90 days following the end of the 12-month period
beginning with the first month of the Company's first fiscal quarter
commencing after the effective date of each registration statement filed
pursuant to this Agreement.

          4.9.  Make reasonably available for inspection by any Selling
Holder, any underwriter participating in such offering and the
representatives of such Selling Holder and Underwriter (but not more than
one firm of legal counsel to such Selling Holders), all financial and other

Selling Holder, any underwriter participating in such offering and the
representatives of such Selling Holder and Underwriter the opportunity to
discuss the business affairs of the Company with its principal executives
and independent public accountants who have certified the audited financial
statements included in such registration statement, in each case to the
extent necessary to enable them to exercise their due diligence
responsibility under the Securities Act; provided, however, that information
                                         --------  -------
that the Company determines, in good faith, to be confidential and which the
Company advises such Person in writing, is confidential shall not be
disclosed unless such Person signs a confidentiality agreement reasonably
satisfactory to the Company.

          4.10.  In the event of a Demand Registration Statement, use the
Company's reasonable best efforts to obtain a "comfort letter" from its
independent public accountants and legal opinions of counsel to the Company
addressed to the Selling Holders, in customary form and covering such matters
of the type customarily covered by such letters and in a form that shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Majority Selling Holders.  The Company shall
furnish to each Selling Holder a signed counterpart of any such comfort
letter or legal opinion.  Delivery of any comfort letter shall be subject to
the recipient furnishing such written representations or acknowledgments as
are customarily provided by selling stockholders who receive such comfort
letters under SAS No. 72.  Nothing in the immediately preceding sentence
shall be deemed to require a Selling Holder to make representations and
warranties if the Selling Holder is willing to receive a letter in the form
to be provided to selling stockholders not making representations and
warranties under SAS No. 76.

          4.11.  Provide and cause to be maintained a transfer agent and
registrar for all Registrable Securities covered by such registration

recognized trading market, to continue to be so listed or included for a
reasonable period of time after the offering.

          Section 5.  Holders' Obligations.
                      --------------------

with the Company in preparing such registration statement and in complying
with the requirements of the Securities Act;

          (ii)  agree to sell their Registrable Securities to the
underwriters at the same price and on substantially the same terms and

and  execute the  underwriting agreement  agreed to  by the  Company  and the
Majority Selling Holders and customary custody arrangements, lock-up letters,
indemnities, questionnaires and other documents reasonably required by the
underwriters or agents and agreed to by the Majority Selling Holders.

          5.2.  In the event that a Demand Registration Statement or a
Piggyback Registration Statement becomes effective, if and to the extent
requested by the managing underwriter or lead agent for the offering relating
thereto, no Holder shall offer, sell or agree to sell or otherwise dispose
of or transfer any Registrable Securities or securities convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for any Registrable Securities (other than, in
the case of the Selling Holders under the Demand Registration Statement or
Piggyback Registration Statement, pursuant to such Demand Registration
Statement or Piggyback Registration Statement, as the case may be), or
exercise any right to register any such securities, during the period
commending ten days prior to the anticipated effective date of such 
registration statement and ending 120 days from the effective date of such

Company shall be entitled to impose stop-transfer instructions with respect
to the Registrable Securities of each Holder until the end of such period.

                                                                 --------
however, that, the Selling Holders shall pay (i) underwriting discounts and
- - -------
commissions relating to the Registrable Securities sold by them pursuant to
any such registration statement and (ii) all fees and disbursements of
counsel and any other advisors to the Selling Holders.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall the obligations of MKO under this Section 6.1
                                                               -----------
exceed $75,000 in the aggregate.  In no event shall MKO be responsible for
the expenses of a Demand Registration Statement.  To the extent MKO is not
required by this Section to pay or reimburse the Company for expenses
incurred in connection with a Shelf Registration Statement, those expenses
shall be borne and paid by the Company, except as expressly otherwise
provided in the first sentence of this Section.

          6.2.  The Company shall bear and pay all Registration Expenses
incurred in connection with any Piggyback Registration Statements pursuant
to Section 3, other than (i) underwriting discounts and commissions relating
   ---------
to Registrable Securities, (ii) the portion of any filing fees allocable to
the Registrable Securities included in such registration by the Holders and
(iii) the fees and disbursements of any counsel and other advisors to the
Selling Holders (each of which expenses in clauses (i) and (ii) shall be paid
on a pro rata basis by the Selling Holders of Registrable Securities included
in such Piggyback Registration Statement and which expenses in clause (iii)
shall be paid on a pro rata basis by the Selling Holders for which the
expenses are incurred).

          Section 7.  Indemnification; Contribution.  If any Registrable
                      -----------------------------
Securities are included in a registration statement under this Agreement:

          7.1.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company shall
indemnify and hold harmless each Selling Holder, its directors, officers,
shareholders, employees, investment advisors, agents and Affiliates, either
direct or indirect (and each such Affiliate's directors, officers,
shareholders, employees, investment advisors and agents) and each other
Person, if any, who controls such Selling Holder within the meaning of the
Securities Act against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements and expenses of
investigation, incurred by such party pursuant to any actual or threatened
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, to which any of the foregoing
Persons may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or
other federal or state laws, insofar as such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement
or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration
statement, including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained
therein, or any amendments or supplements thereto, or the omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein, or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (collectively, a
"Violation"); provided, however, that the indemnification required by this
              --------  -------
Section 7.1 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss,
- - -----------
claim, damage, liability or expense if such settlement is effected without
the consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld), nor shall the Company be liable in any such case for any such
loss, claim, damage, liability or expense to the extent that it arises out
of or is based upon a Violation which occurs in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished to the Company by the
indemnified party expressly for use in connection with such registration.

          7.2.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, each Selling
Holder shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors,
officers, shareholders, employees, investment advisors, agents and
Affiliates, either direct or indirect (and each such Affiliate's directors,
officers, shareholders, employees, investment advisors and agents) and each
other Person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the
Securities act, any other Selling Holder and any controlling Person or any
such other Selling Holder against any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements and
expenses of investigation, incurred by such party pursuant to any actual or
threatened action, suit, proceeding or investigation, to which any of the
foregoing Persons may otherwise become subject under the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act or other federal or state laws, insofar as such losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and expenses arise out of or are based upon any
Violation, in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such
Violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information
furnished by such Selling Holder expressly for use in connection with such
registration statement; provided, however, that (x) the indemnification
                        --------  -------
required by this Section 7.2 shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement
                 -----------
of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense if settlement is
effected without the consent of the relevant Selling Holder of Registrable
Securities, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, (y) in no event
shall the amount of any indemnity under this Section 7.2 and of the
                                             -----------
contribution obligation of a Selling Holder under Section 7.4 exceed the net
                                                  -----------
proceeds from the applicable offering received by such Selling Holder, and
(z) the obligation to provide indemnification hereunder shall be several, and
not joint and several, among the indemnifying parties.

          7.3.  Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this
Section 7 of notice of the commencement of any action, suit, proceeding,
- - ---------
investigation or threat thereof made in writing for which such indemnified
party may make a claim under this Section 7, such indemnified party shall
                                  ---------
deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement
thereof.  The failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party
within a reasonable time following the commencement of any such action , if
and to the extent materially prejudicial to its ability to defend such
action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the
indemnified party under this Section 7 but shall not relieve the indemnifying
                             ---------
party of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise
than pursuant to this Section 7.  Any fees and expenses incurred by the
                      ---------
indemnified party (including any fees and expenses incurred in connection
with investigating or preparing to defend such action or proceeding) shall
be paid to the indemnified party, as incurred, within thirty days of written
notice thereof to the indemnifying party (regardless of whether it is
ultimately determined that an indemnified party is not entitled to
indemnification hereunder).  Any such indemnified party shall have the right
to employ separate counsel in any such action, claim or proceeding and to
participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
shall be the expenses of such indemnified party unless(i) the indemnifying
party shall have failed to promptly assume the defense of such action, claim
or proceeding or (ii) the named parties to any such action, claim or
proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both such indemnified
party and the indemnifying party, and such indemnified party shall have been
advised by its counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available
to it which are different from or in addition to those available to the
indemnifying party and that the assertion of such defenses would create a
conflict of interest such that counsel employed by the indemnifying party
could not represent the indemnified party  (in which case, if such
indemnified party notifies the indemnifying party in writing that it elects
to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the
indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such
action, claim or proceeding on behalf of such indemnified party; it being
understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection
with any one such action, claim or proceeding or separate but substantially
similar or related actions, claims or proceedings in the same jurisdiction
arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for
the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys
(together with appropriate local counsel) at any time for all such
indemnified parties, unless the indemnified party shall have been advised by
its counsel that a conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified
party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such action,
claim or proceeding such that the counsel could not represent the indemnified
party and any other of such indemnified parties, in which event the
indemnifying party shall be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of such
additional counsel or counsels).  No indemnifying party shall be liable to
an indemnified party for any settlement of any action, proceeding or claim
without the written consent of the indemnifying party, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld.

          7.4.  If the indemnification required by this Section 7 from the
                                                        ---------
indemnifying party is unavailable to an indemnified party hereunder in
respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to
in this Section 7:
        ---------

          (i)  The indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such
indemnified party,  shall contribute  to the amount  paid or payable  by such
indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities
or expenses in  such proportion  as is  appropriate to  reflect the  relative
fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified parties in connection with
the actions  which resulted  in such loses,  claims, damages,  liabilities or
expense,  as  well as  any  other  relevant  equitable considerations.    The
relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified parties shall be
determined by  reference to,  among other things,  whether any  Violation has
been committed by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying
party or indemnified parties, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge,
access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such Violation. 
The amount paid  or payable by  a party  as a result  of the losses,  claims,
damages,  liabilities and  expenses  referred  to above  shall  be deemed  to
include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2,
                                                 -----------     -----------
any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in
connection with any investigation or proceeding.

          (ii)  The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7.4 were determined
                                           -----------
by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not
take into account the equitable considerations referred to in Section 7.4(i).
                                                              --------------
No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of
Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from
any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

          7.5.  The obligations of the Company and the Selling Holders of
Registrable Securities under this Section 7 shall survive the completion of
                                  ---------
any offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to a registration statement
under this Agreement.

          Section 8.  Transfer of Common Stock.  Notwithstanding anything in
                      ------------------------
this Agreement to the contrary, no Holder may Transfer any shares of Common
Stock to any Person, except as set forth in the last paragraph of this
Section 8, unless prior to any such Transfer such Person has executed an
- - ---------
agreement (in the form of Exhibit A hereto) to be bound by the provisions of
                          ---------
this Agreement.  The Company shall place the following legend on any
certificate representing shares of Common Stock held by a Holder:

          "This security is subject to certain restrictions on transfer
contained in a stockholders Agreement dated as of ____, 1996 between MK Rail
Corporation  and Morrison  Knudsen Corporation  to which  the holder  of this
certificate is bound, a copy of which agreement is on file with the Secretary
of MK Rail Corporation."

          In order to enforce the foregoing transfer restriction, without
limiting any other rights or remedies available to the Company, the Company
shall be entitled to impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to the
Registrable Securities of each Holder.  The foregoing transfer restrictions
and legend shall be removed in connection with any sale of Common Stock to
the public pursuant to an effective registration statement or pursuant to
Rule 144 or any similar rule promulgated by the Commission under the
Securities Act, in each case so long as the specific identities of the
Transferees are not known to the Holders selling such shares prior to such
sale.

          Section 9.  Corporate Governance Agreement.
                      ------------------------------

          9.1.  Until either the second anniversary of the Distribution Date
(or, if an effective Election Request, as defined in Section 9.6 hereof, is
                                                     -----------
made and the Stockholders Meeting, as defined in Section 9.7 hereof, is held
prior thereto, the date of the Stockholders Meeting), each Holder (i) shall
vote all of its shares of Registrable Securities and any other voting
securities of the Company over which such Holder exercises voting power (or
execute written consents in lieu of meetings) in favor of the election of
the Company's nominees for director and against the removal of any of the
Company's directors (other than a removal for cause) at any meeting of
stockholders or in any action by written consent and (ii) shall take all
other necessary or desirable actions within such Holder's control
(including, but not limited to, attendance at annual or special stockholder
meetings of the Company in person or by proxy for purposes of obtaining a
quorum) to elect such nominees and to vote against such removal of
any of the Company's directors; provided, however, that the total number
                                --------  -------
of directors on the Company's Board of Directors shall not be fewer than
seven and a majority of such directors shall at all times consist of Outside
Directors.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Holder shall not be required to
vote any voting securities of the Company over which such Holder exercises
voting power that are not Registrable Securities (or execute written
consents in lieu of meetings with respect to such voting securities) as
otherwise required by this Section to the extent the voting securities are
held or controlled by the Holder as an agent, custodian, trustee or
executor, in all cases for or on behalf of parties that are not Holders of
Registrable Securities or their Affiliates or associates (as defined in the
rules promulgated under the Exchange Act), or are controlled by the Holder
as an investment advisor for an investment company registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or as an investment advisor for
any other person or group; provided that in all cases, the arrangement
                           --------
whereby the Holder owns or controls the voting securities has not been
entered into for the purpose of circumventing this Section; and further
                                                                -------
provided, in the case of securities controlled by the Holder as an
- - --------
investment advisor for a person or group that is not an investment company
registered under the Investment Company Act, that no Holder or Holders has a
direct economic beneficial interest in the person or group for which the
Holder so acts as an investment advisor.

          9.2.  Without the prior written consent of the Company, until
either (i) ninety (90) days prior to the scheduled date of the Stockholders
Meeting (if an effective Election Request is made pursuant to Section 9.6
hereof) or (ii) the second anniversary of the Distribution Date (if no
effective Election Request is made) (in either case, the "Standstill
Termination Date"), no Holder may (i) solicit proxies (as such terms are
defined in Rule 14a-1 under the Exchange Act), whether or not such
solicitation is exempt under 14a-2 under the Exchange Act, with respect to
any matter from holders of any shares of common or preferred stock of the
Company, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for or
exercisable (whether currently or upon the occurrence of any contingency) for
the purchase of any such capital stock, or make any communication exempted
from the definition of solicitation by Rule 14a-1(I)(2)(iv) under the
Exchange Act, or (ii) initiate, or induce or attempt to induce any other
Person or group (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) to
initiate, any stockholder proposal or tender offer for securities of the
Company or any subsidiary thereof, any change of control of the Company or
any subsidiary thereof or the convening of a stockholders' meeting of the
Company or any subsidiary thereof; or (iii) otherwise seek or propose (or
request permission to propose) to influence or control the management or
policies of the Company or any subsidiary thereof.  Nothing herein shall be
deemed to apply to a Holder to the extent the Holder is acting solely in its
capacity as an agent, custodian, trustee or executor holding securities that
are not Registrable Securities for persons that are not Holders or Affiliates
of Holders, provided that the Holder's actions are (a) at the direction of
            --------
a person or persons that are not Holders that are the beneficial owners of
the securities so held by the Holder or (b) arise from the fiduciary duties
of the Holder acting in such capacity ascertained in good faith after
consulting with and based on advice of counsel as described in reasonable
detail in a written notice given the Company at least thirty (30) days prior
to taking such action; and further provided that in all cases the arrangement
                       --------------------
whereby the Holder holds the securities has not been entered into, and the
action by the Holder has not been taken, for the purpose of circumventing
this Section.

          9.3.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
provisions of Sections 9.1 and 9.2 hereof shall terminate at such time prior
              ------------     ---
to the second anniversary of the Distribution Date, if ever, that all of the
Registrable Securities held by all Holders constitutes less than 15% of the
outstanding Common Stock.

          9.4.  For so long as the provisions of Section 9.1 hereof are in
                                                 -----------
force and effect, the Company shall not amend the Rights Plan (i) to change
the percentage used in the definition of "Acquiring Person" therein so that
it is less than fifteen percent (15%) or (ii) in any other manner that would
deprive the Holders of the Registrable Securities of the intended benefits
of the Rights Plan Amendment.

          9.5.  At the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the
Company scheduled to occur at least seventy-five (75) days after the
effective date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company shall
propose to the stockholders of the Company, shall recommend approval of, and
shall solicit proxies voting to approve an amendment (the "Certificate
Amendment") to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the
Company, as amended, that, if adopted and approved by the requisite vote of
the stockholders of the Company, would amend the first sentence of Section
3 of the Seventh Article thereof in its entirety so it states as follows:

          Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any series
of   Preferred  Stock  to  elect  additional  directors  under  circumstances
specified  in  a  Preferred Stock  Designation,  newly  created directorships
resulting from any increase in the number of Directors and any vacancies on 
the Board resulting from death, resignation, disqualifications, removal or
other cause, will be filled solely by the affirmative vote of the majority
of the remaining Directors, then in office, even though less than a quorum
of the Board, or by a sole remaining Director; provided, however, that at the
sole option of the Board, effected by resolution of the Board of Directors,
one or more such vacancies or newly created directorships may be filled by
the stockholders at  a meeting  of the  stockholders called by  the Board  of
Directors.

If the Certificate Amendment is effectively adopted and approved by the
stockholders of the Company, the Board of Directors shall make a conforming
amendment to the first sentence of By-Law 11 of the By-Laws of the Company.

          9.6.  The Holders shall have the right at their option to request
that the Company hold a meeting of the stockholders as provided herein by
delivery of a written request (the "Election Request") to the Secretary of
the Company at its principal executive offices not more than one hundred
twenty (120) nor less than ninety (90) days prior to the second anniversary
of the Distribution Date, which Election Request shall identify each of the
Holders making the Election Request and shall include the information they
would be required to give under By-Law 13 of the By-Laws of the Company as
in effect on the date hereof as if they were making nominations for positions
as directors at an annual meeting or the stockholders of the Company.  An
Election Request shall be ineffective if it has not been executed by Holders
owning Registrable Securities constituting at least fifteen percent (15%) of
the outstanding Common Stock of the Company as of the ninetieth (90th) day
prior to the second anniversary of the Distribution Date and shall cease to
be effective if prior to the second anniversary of the Distribution Date the
Holders executing the Election Request cease to own registrable securities
constituting at least fifteen percent (15%) of the outstanding Common Stock
of the Company.  If no effective Election Request is delivered to the
Secretary of the Company at the Company's principal executive offices not
more than on hundred twenty (120) nor less than ninety (90) days prior to
said second anniversary of the Distribution Date or if, prior to the second
anniversary of the Distribution Date, the Election Request ceases to be
effective, the Holders shall have no further rights under this Section.

          9.7.  Provided the Certificate Amendment has been adopted and
approved, upon receipt of an effective Election Request, unless and until it
becomes ineffective, the Board of Directors of the Company shall call a
meeting of the stockholders of the Company to beheld as closely as
practicable to the second anniversary of the Distribution Date (which meeting
may be the annual meeting of stockholders) (the "Stockholders Meeting"), at
which meeting the stockholders of the Company shall be entitled to vote to
fill vacancies and/or newly-created positions on the Board of Directors of
the Company, which vacancies and/or newly created positions, when filled,
will constitute a majority of the Company's Board of Directors.

          9.8.  Nothing in Section 9.6 or 9.7 hereof shall be deemed to
                           -----------    ---
amend, modify or waive any provisions of the By-Laws of the Company,
including, without limitation, those regarding the manner in which
stockholders of the Company may make proposals or nominations at meetings of
such stockholders, all of which shall continue to be in full force and effect
with respect to the Stockholders Meeting, if it is held.  The provisions 
of By-Law 13 of the Company's By-Laws shall be in full force and effect with
respect to all nominations to fill vacancies at the Stockholders Meeting, if
it is held.

          Section 10.  Amendment, Modification and Waivers; Further
                       --------------------------------------------
Assurances.
- - ----------

          10.1.  This Agreement may be amended with the consent of the
Company, and the Company may take any action herein prohibited, or omit to
perform any act herein required to be performed by it, only if the Company
shall have obtained the written consent of Holders owning Registrable
Securities possessing a majority in number of the Registrable Securities than
outstanding to such amendment, action or omission to act.

          10.2.  No waiver of any terms or conditions of this Agreement shall
operate as a waiver of any other breach of such terms and conditions or any
other term or condition, nor shall any failure to enforce any provision
hereof operate as a wavier of such provision or of any other provision
hereof.  No written waiver hereunder, unless it by its own terms explicitly
provides to the contrary, shall be construed to effect a continuing waiver
of the provisions being waived and no such waiver in any instance shall
constitute a waiver in any other instance or for any other purpose or impair
the right of the party against whom such waiver is claimed in all other
instances or for all other purposes to require full compliance with such
provision.

          10.3.  Each of the parties hereto shall execute all such further
instruments and documents and take all such further action as any other party
hereto may reasonably require in order to effectuate the terms and purposes
of this Agreement.

          Section 11.  Assignment; Benefit.  This Agreement and all of the
                       -------------------
provisions hereof shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective heirs, permitted assigns, executors,
administrators or successors; provided, however, that except as specifically
                              --------  -------
provided herein with respect to certain matters, neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned or
delegated by the Company without the prior written consent of Holders owning
Registrable Securities possessing a majority in number of Registrable
Securities then outstanding on the date as of which such delegation or
assignment is to become effective.  A Holder may Transfer its rights
hereunder to a successor in interest to the Registrable Securities owned by
such assignor only as permitted by Section 8.

                     AMENDMENT TO STOCKHOLDERS AGREEMENT
                     -----------------------------------

     This Amendment to Stockholders Agreement (the "Amendment"), dated as of
July __, 1996, between MK Rail Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("MK
Rail"), and Morrison Knudsen Corporation, an Ohio corporation ("MKO").

     WHEREAS, in connection with the reorganization of Morrison Knudsen
Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("MK"), in a case filed under Title 11
of the United States Bankruptcy Code, as amended (the "Bankruptcy Code"), MK
Rail and MKO executed and delivered a Stockholders Agreement (the
"Agreement") dated as of June 20, 1996; and

     WHEREAS, the Agreement contains certain agreements regarding the
registration and voting of restricted shares of common stock of MK Rail held
by MKO which stock it was contemplated would be distributed to certain
creditors of MK and MKO; and

     WHEREAS, as a result of negotiations between MK and equity holders of
MK, it is contemplated that MK's plan of reorganization will be amended so
that it provides for rights or options to be granted to equity holders of MK
which will permit them, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, to
receive a portion of the restricted shares of common stock of MK Rail held
by MKO; and

     WHEREAS, MK has made a motion (an "1145 Motion") requesting that the
Bankruptcy Court having jurisdiction over MK's bankruptcy proceeding issue
an order (an "1145 Order") providing that the offering, issuance, sale and
distribution by MKO of the common stock of MK Rail qualifies for the
exemption (the "1145 Exemption"), available under Section 1145(a) of the
Bankruptcy Code, from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended; and

     WHEREAS, the Securities and Exchange Commission has stated that it will
not object to the 1145 Motion; and

     WHEREAS, the parties wish to amend the Agreement as set forth herein to
make certain changes thereto necessitated by the possibility that equity
holders of MK may acquire some restricted shares of Common Stock and that the
1145 Motion has been made;

     NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

     1.  The term "Rights Plan Amendments" is hereby amended and restated in
its entirety so it means the Second Amendment to Rights Agreement dated as
of June 20, 1996 and the Third Amendment to Rights Agreement of even date
herewith between MK Rail and Chase Mellon Shareholder Services, L.L.C.,
formerly known as Chemical Mellon Shareholders Services, L.L.C.

     2.  The following language is added at the end of the last sentence of
the definition of "Registrable Securities" in Section 1.1 of the Agreement:

     or in "ordinary trading transaction" within the meaning of Section
1145(b)(1) of the United States Bankruptcy Code, as amended (the "Bankruptcy
Code").

     3.  The reference to "creditors of MK" in the definition of "Shares" in
Section 1.1 of the Agreement is hereby changed to a reference to "persons."

     4.  The first sentence of Section 8 of the Agreement is hereby amended
in its entirety to read as follows:

     Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no
Holder may Transfer any shares of Common Stock to any Person, except as set
forth in the last paragraph of this Section 8, unless prior to any
                                    ---------
such Transfer such Person has executed an agreement (in the form
of Exhibit A hereto) to be bound, or has otherwise been effectively bound
   ---------
pursuant to the Plan, by the provisions of this Agreement.

     5.  The last sentence of Section 8 of the Agreement is hereby amended,
restated and replaced in its entirety by the following sentences:

     MKO may distribute shares of Common Stock to equity holders of MK
provided that (a)  the 1145 Order  has been issued and  is in full  force and
effect and is  not the subject  of a  pending appeal at  the time the  Common
Stock is distributed and (b) each equity holder receiving such Common Stock
has executed an agreement (in the form of Exhibit A hereto) to be bound, or
                                          ---------
has otherwise been effectively bound pursuant to the Plan, by the provisions
of this Agreement.  No distribution of Common Stock to equity holders or any
other party in a distribution that qualifies for the 1145 Exemption shall
excuse any party from or be deemed to constitute a release of the transfer
restrictions and legending requirements set forth in this Section 8, except
                                                          ---------
as set forth in the last sentence of this paragraph, and all Common Stock so
distributed shall after such distribution be subject to said transfer
restrictions and legend requirements as well as all other terms and
conditions hereof.  The foregoing transfer restrictions and legend shall be
removed in connection with any sale of Common Stock to the public pursuant
to an effective registration statement or pursuant to Rule 144 or any
similar rule promulgated by the Commission under the Securities Act, or in
"ordinary trading transactions" within the meaning of Section 1145(b)(1) of
the Bankruptcy Code, in each case so long as the specific identities of the
Transferees are not known to the Holders selling such shares prior to such
sale and so long as the Transferees are not assigned and do not receive any
rights under this Agreement.  The Company may also put following legend on
certificates of stock held by Transferees of MKO and their Transferees that
are bound to the terms of this Agreement:

          THE SHARES OF STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE
NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "ACT"),
OR ANY STATE SECURITIES LAWS.  SUCH SHARES OF STOCK MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED
EXCEPT (1) PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION STATEMENT EFFECTIVE UNDER THE ACT AND
ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS, (2) PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM THE
REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE ACT AND ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAW,
OR (3) IF THE STOCK HAS BEEN RECEIVED BY THE HOLDER HEREOF IN A DISTRIBUTION
THAT QUALIFIES FOR THE EXEMPTION, AVAILABLE UNDER SECTION 1145(A) OF THE
UNITED STATES  BANKRUPTCY CODE,  AS AMENDED (THE  "BANKRUPTCY CODE"),  TO THE
REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE ACT, IN ORDINARY TRADING TRANSACTIONS WITHIN
THE MEANING OF SECTION 1145(b)(1) OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE.

     6.  All terms and provisions of the Agreement, as amended hereby, shall
continue to be in full force and effect.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have hereunto set their hands as of
the day and year first set forth above.
