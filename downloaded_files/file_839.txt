Item 3.   Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.

          Since December 6, 1995, the date of the original schedule 13D
          filing of the Reporting Parties, Aries Domestic and the Aries Trust
          acquired additional securities of the Issuer as detailed below.  On
          October 8, 1996, Aries Domestic received warrants to purchase
          45,000 shares of common stock of the Issuer, and the Aries Trust
          received warrants to purchase 105,000 shares of common stock of the
          Issuer in connection with a line of credit of up to $500,000 which
          Aries Domestic and the Aries Trust extended to the Issuer.  

          In connection with the closing (the "Closing") of a private
          offering (the "Offering") of securities of the Issuer, Aries
          Domestic used its general funds to effect the purchase of 8.6 units
          (the "Units"), each Unit consisting of 500 shares of Premium
          Preferred Stock (the "Preferred Stock") and warrants to purchase
          50,000 shares of common stock of the Issuer for an aggregate amount
          of 4,299 shares of Preferred Stock (which shares of Preferred Stock
          are convertible into 895,625 shares of common stock of the Issuer
          based on a conversion rate of 208.33 shares of common stock per
          share of preferred stock) and warrants to purchase 429,900 shares
          of common stock of the Issuer for an approximate aggregate purchase
          price of $860,000. On the same date and in the same Offering, the
          Aries Trust used its general funds to effect the purchase of 16.68
          Units for an aggregate amount of 8,340 shares of Preferred Stock
          (which shares of Preferred Stock are convertible into 1,737,500
          shares of common stock of the Issuer based on a conversion rate of
          208.33 shares of common stock per share of preferred stock) and
          warrants to purchase 834,000 shares of common stock of the Issuer
          for an approximate aggregate purchase price of $1,668,000. 

          In addition, the Aries Domestic also received 0.86 Unit Purchase
          Options to purchase 430 shares of Preferred Stock (convertible into
          89,562 shares of common stock of the Issuer based on a conversion
          rate of 208.33 shares of common stock per share of preferred stock)
          and warrants to purchase 42,990 shares of common stock of the
          Issuer. Similarly, the Aries Trust received 1.668 Unit Purchase
          Options to purchase 834 shares of Preferred Stock of the Issuer
          (convertible into 173,750 shares of common stock of the Issuer
          based on a conversion rate of 208.33 shares of common stock per
          share of preferred stock) and warrants to purchase 83,400 shares of
          common stock of the Issuer.

Item 4.   Purpose of Transaction.

          The Reporting Parties have acquired shares of Common Stock of the
          Issuer as an investment in the Issuer.

          In December, 1996, the Issuer effected certain changes to its
          management and Board of Directors, including but not limited to,
          replacing its Chief Executive Officer.  Mr. Michael S. Weiss, a
          member of the Issuer's Board of Directors and Senior Managing
          Director of Paramount Capital, Inc. (an investment bank related to
          Paramount Capital), voted in favor of these changes. As previously
          set forth in Item 4., Paramount Capital, Inc. has acted as
          placement agent for the Issuer in connection with its November,
          1995 and March, 1996 private offering of securities.

          Except as indicated in this Schedule 13D, the Reporting Parties
          currently have no plans or proposals that relate to or would result
          in any of the matters described in subparagraphs (a) through (j) of
          Item 4 of Schedule 13D.

Item 5.   Interest in Securities of the Issuer.

          (a)  As of April 15, 1997, Paramount Capital, through acquisition
               of the shares by the Aries Trust and Aries Domestic,

          Paramount Capital is the investment manager of the Aries Trust and
          the General Partner of Aries Domestic and in such capacities has
          the authority to make certain investment decisions on behalf of
          such entities, including decisions relating to the securities of
          the Issuer.  In connection with its investment management duties,
          Paramount Capital receives certain management fees and performance
          allocations from the Aries Trust and Aries Domestic.  Dr. Rosenwald
          is the sole shareholder of Paramount Capital.  

          Paramount Capital, Inc. has acted as placement agent for the Issuer

          of Paramount Capital, Inc., serves as a member of the Board of

          On November 27, 1995 Paramount Capital, Inc. and the Issuer entered
          into a Financial Advisory Agreement whereby Paramount Capital, Inc.
          agreed to act as a non-exclusive Financial Advisor to the Issuer
          and to identify and negotiate potential acquisition candidates,
          investments and/or strategic alliances.  Pursuant to a Placement
          Agency Agreement entered into between Paramount Capital, Inc. and
          the Issuer dated September 27, 1996, the parties agreed to extend
          the Financial Advisory Agreement for an additional eighteen (18)
          months.  

          In addition, as described in Item 3, Aries Domestic and the Aries
          Trust extended a line of credit of up to $500,000, which the
          Company has not yet repaid.

          Except as indicated in this 13D and exhibits hereto, there is no
          contract, arrangement, understanding or relationship between the
          Reporting Parties and any other party or parties, with respect to
          any securities of the Issuer.
