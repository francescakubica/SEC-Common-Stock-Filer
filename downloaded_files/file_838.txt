Item 3 - Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration

EQAT, a Delaware  business trust wholly owned by Equitable,  acquired its Shares
of the  Issuer  upon the  exercise  on March 12,  1996 of an option  granted  in
connection  with  the  comprehensive  restructuring  of  the  Issuer's  and  its
subsidiaries'  financial obligations.  The option was granted on January 2, 1996
in consideration for the exchange on that date of $28,112,007  principal amount,
plus accrued  interest,  of 11% notes of Cafeteria  Operators,  L.P., a Delaware
limited   partnership   ("Cafeteria   Operators")   and  indirect   wholly-owned
partnership  subsidiary  of the Issuer,  for a limited  partnership  interest in
Cafeteria Operators. Pursuant to a Put Agreement, dated as of December 14, 1995,
among the Issuer,  EQAT,  Equitable,  and other  investors  named therein,  this
option was  exercisable by the holders (acting  independently)  of a majority of
the Cafeteria Operators limited  partnership  interests received in exchange for
the Cafeteria Operators notes. Pursuant to the terms of the Put Agreement,  upon
exercise of the option by the  required  majority  (which  occurred on March 12,
1996),  all investors  (including EQAT) that had exchanged  Cafeteria  Operators
notes for Cafeteria Operators limited partnership  interests were deemed to have
exercised such option as well.  Accordingly,  on March 12, 1996,  EQAT's limited
partnership  interest in Cafeteria  Operators was  transferred  to the Issuer in
exchange for the Shares.

                                       16

Item 4 - Purpose of Transaction

EQAT acquired its Shares of the Issuer  reported in this Schedule 13D solely for
investment  purposes in connection with the  comprehensive  restructuring of the
Issuer's and its subsidiaries'  financial  obligations,  as further described in
Item 3  above.  EQAT  currently  has no  contracts  or  arrangements  concerning
disposition of the Shares.  However,  under the Exchange Agreement,  dated as of
November 15, 1995, among the Issuer,  Cafeteria Operators,  EQAT, Equitable, and
other investors named therein,  EQAT has the right to have its Shares registered
for resale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities  Act").
On May 3, 1996, the Issuer filed a  Registration  Statement on Form S-1 pursuant
to such  registration  rights on behalf of EQAT as well as other  holders of the
Issuer's  common stock.  The Issuer filed  Amendment No. 1 to this  Registration
Statement on June 27, 1996.

Item 5 - Interest in Securities of the Issuer

EQAT is holder of record of the 8,499,857  Shares reported in this Schedule 13D,
or  approximately  17.46%  of  the  Shares  outstanding  as  of  June  21,  1996
(percentage  of  outstanding  based on  information  provided  by the  Issuer in
Amendment  No. 1, filed June 27,  1996,  to its  Registration  Statement on Form
S-1).  Equitable is the  beneficiary  and owner of EQAT. The collateral of EQAT,
which  includes  the  Shares,  is managed by Alliance  pursuant to a  Collateral
Management  Agreement.  The Shares and such Collateral Management Agreement have
been  pledged  to The Chase  Manhattan  Bank,  N.A.  as  directed  trustee  (the
"Trustee")  for the  benefit and  security of holders of certain  notes of EQAT.
Alliance and EQAT  (through the Trustee)  share the power to vote and to dispose
of the 8,499,857 Shares reported in this Schedule 13D.

Equitable, as beneficiary and owner of EQAT, may be deemed, for purposes of Rule
13d-3 under the  Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934,  as amended  (the  "Exchange
Act"), to beneficially own indirectly the Shares held of record by EQAT.

Because of AXA's ownership  interest in Equitable,  and the AXA Voting Trustees'
power to vote the Equitable  shares placed in the AXA Voting Trust,  each of AXA
and the AXA Voting Trustees may be deemed,  for purposes of Rule 13d-3 under the
Exchange Act, to  beneficially  own  indirectly the Shares that Equitable may be
deemed to  beneficially  own  indirectly.  Because of the  direct  and  indirect
ownership  interest in AXA of Finaxa and the  Mutuelles  AXA, each of Finaxa and
the Mutuelles  AXA may be deemed,  for purposes of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange
Act,  to  beneficially  own  indirectly  the  Shares  that AXA may be  deemed to
beneficially own indirectly.  AXA, Finaxa, the Mutuelles AXA, and the AXA Voting
Trustees disclaim beneficial ownership of any Shares.

The Reporting  Persons,  in the  aggregate,  may be deemed to  beneficially  own
8,499,857 Shares, or approximately  17.46% of the Shares  outstanding as of June
21, 1996. The percentage of Shares outstanding reported as beneficially owned by
each  person  herein  on  the  date  hereof  is  based  upon  48,669,340  Shares
outstanding  as of June 21, 1996,  as reported by the Issuer in Amendment No. 1,
filed June 27, 1996, to its Registration Statement on Form S-1.

Item 6 - Contracts,  Arrangements,  Understandings or Relationships With Respect
to Securities of the Issuer.

The Shares of the Issuer are pledged to the Trustee under that Indenture,  dated
as of August 31, 1993 (the "Indenture"),  between EQAT (as issuer) and The Chase
Manhattan Bank,  N.A. (as Trustee),  for the benefit and security of the holders
of certain notes issued under the Indenture. EQAT is managed by Alliance under a
Collateral Management Agreement, dated August 31, 1993 (the "CMA"), between EQAT
and Alliance.  The CMA has been pledged to the Trustee,  and Alliance's power to
vote the Shares is governed  by the terms of the  Indenture  and the CMA.  After
payment in full of all notes issued under the Indenture and all related fees and
expenses,  all collateral  pledged under the Indenture is paid to Equitable,  as
Owner of EQAT.

Item 7 - Material to be Filed as Exhibits

1. Joint Filing Agreement among the Reporting Persons to file a joint statement
   on Schedule 13D.

2. Powers of Attorney
