PRELIMINARY NOTE

         The persons filing this Amendment No. 6 are (i) Tweedy, Browne Company
LLC ("TBC"), a Delaware limited liability company, (ii) TBK Partners, L.P.
("TBK"), a Delaware limited partnership and (iii) Vanderbilt Partners, L.P.
("Vanderbilt"), a Delaware limited partnership. This Amendment No. 6 amends a
Statement on Schedule 13D filed by TBC, TBK and Vanderbilt dated August 27, 1992
( the "Statement"). The filing of this Amendment No. 6 should not be deemed an
admission that TBC, TBK and Vanderbilt comprise a group within the meaning of
Section 13(d) (3) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Act").

         Tweedy, Browne Company L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the
"Partnership") and its general partners entered into a definitive agreement,
pursuant to which the Partnership converted to Tweedy, Browne Company LLC (the
"Company"), a Delaware limited liability company, and AMG/TBC Holdings, Inc.
("Holdings"), a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Affiliated
Managers Group, Inc. (a Boston- based holding company, the business address of
which is Two International Place, Boston, Massachusetts 02110), acquired a
majority interest in the Company on October 9, 1997.

         This Amendment No. 6 relates to the Common Stock, $.01 par value (the
"Common Stock"), of HPSC, Inc. (The "Company"), which, to the best knowledge of
the persons filing this Amendment No. 6, is a company organized under the laws
of Delaware, with its principal executive offices at 25 Stuart Street, Boston,
MA 02116.

         This Amendment No. 6 contains information regarding shares of Common
Stock that may be deemed to be beneficially owned by TBC. Such shares are held
in the accounts of various customers of TBC, with respect to which it has
obtained sole or shared voting power.

         Other than as set forth below, to the best knowledge of TBC, TBK and
Vanderbilt, there has been no material change in the information set forth in
response to Items 1,2,3,4,6 and 7 of the Statement, as amended. Accordingly,
those Items are omitted from this Amendment No. 6.


ITEM 5.  INTEREST IN SECURITIES OF THE ISSUER

         (a) As of the date hereof, TBC may be deemed to be the beneficial owner
of an aggregate of 311,520 shares of Common Stock, which constitutes
approximately 6.69% of the 4,657,930 shares of Common Stock which TBC believes
to be the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. The TBC Shares are
held in the TBC Accounts.

         As of the date hereof, TBK beneficially owns directly 15,000 shares of
Common Stock, which constitutes approximately 0.32% of the 4,657,930 shares of
Common Stock which TBK believes to be the total number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding.

         As of the date hereof, Vanderbilt beneficially owns directly 10,000
shares of Common Stock, which constitutes approximately 0.21% of the 4,657,930
shares of Common Stock which Vanderbilt believes to be the total number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding.

         Each of TBC, TBK and Vanderbilt disclaims that it is the beneficial
owner of any of the shares of Common Stock held in the TBC Accounts. The
aggregate number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which TBC, TBK and
Vanderbilt could be deemed to be the beneficial owner as of the date hereof, is
336,520 shares, which constitutes approximately 7.22% of the 4,657,930 shares of
Common Stock, which the filing persons believe to be the total number of shares
of Common Stock outstanding, but nothing contained herein shall be construed as
an admission that TBC is the beneficial owner of any of the TBC Shares.

         The aggregate number of shares and percentage of Common Stock with
respect to which each of the General Partners and Members may be deemed to be
the beneficial owner by reason of his being a general partner of TBK and
Vanderbilt, or a member of TBC, is 336,520 shares, which constitutes
approximately 7.22% of the 4,657,930 shares of Common Stock outstanding. The
aggregate number of shares and percentage of Common Stock with respect to which
Thomas P. Knapp may be deemed to be a beneficial owner by reason of his being a
general partner of TBK is 15,000 shares of Common Stock which constitutes
approximately 0.32% of the 4,657,930 shares of Common Stock outstanding.



<PAGE>   7
However, nothing contained herein shall be construed as an admission that any of
the General Partners or Thomas P. Knapp is the beneficial owner of any shares of
Common Stock, except as set forth herein as expressly and admittedly being
beneficially owned by a particular General Partner or Thomas P. Knapp.

         Each of TBC, TBK and Vanderbilt disclaims beneficial ownership of
Common Stock held by the other. Except as described herein, to the best
knowledge of TBC, TBK and Vanderbilt, no person who may be deemed to comprise a
group with any of TBC, TBK, Vanderbilt, or any other person named in Item 2 of
the Statement, beneficially owns any shares of Common Stock.

         (b) TBC has investment discretion with respect to 311,520 shares of
Common Stock held by the TBC Accounts and has sole power to dispose or direct
the disposition of all of such shares. Of these shares of Common Stock, TBC has
sole power to vote or to direct the voting of 283,355 shares of Common Stock
held in certain TBC Accounts.

         Each of the Members of TBC, solely by reason of their positions as
such, may be deemed to have (i) shared power to dispose of or to direct the
disposition of all of the shares of Common Stock held in the TBC Accounts; and
(ii) shared power to vote or direct the vote of 283,355 shares of Common Stock
held in certain TBC Accounts.

         TBK has the sole power to vote or direct the voting of and dispose or
direct the disposition of the TBK Shares. Each of the General Partners and
Thomas P. Knapp, solely by reason of their positions as general partners, may be
