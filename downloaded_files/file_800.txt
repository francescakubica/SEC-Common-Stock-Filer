filed on behalf of the undersigned to amend the Schedule 13D, as
amended (the "Schedule 13D") which was originally filed on June
7, 1994.  Unless otherwise indicated, all capitalized terms used
herein but not defined herein shall have the same meaning as set
forth in the Schedule 13D. 

Item 2.   Identity and Background
          This statement is being filed by Mario J. Gabelli ("Mr.
Gabelli") and various entities which he directly or indirectly
controls or for which he acts as chief investment officer.  These
entities, except for Lynch Corporation ("Lynch"), Spinnaker
Industries, Incorporated ("Spinnaker"), Western New Mexico
Telephone Company ("Western New Mexico"), Entoleter, Inc. ("Ento-
leter"),  Lynch Telecommunications Corporation ("Lynch Telecom"),
Lynch Telephone Corporation ("Lynch Telephone") and Inter-Commu-
nity Telephone Company ("Inter-Community") (collectively, "Lynch
and its affiliates"), engage in various aspects of the securities
business, primarily as investment adviser to various institution-
al and individual clients, including registered investment
companies and pension plans, as broker/dealer and as general
partner of various private investment partnerships.  Certain of
these entities may also make investments for their own accounts. 
          The foregoing persons in the aggregate often own
beneficially more than 5% of a class of equity securities of a
particular issuer.  Although several of the foregoing persons are
treated as institutional investors for purposes of reporting
their beneficial ownership on the short-form Schedule 13G, the
holdings of those who do not qualify as institutional investors
may exceed the 1% threshold presented for filing on Schedule 13G
or implementation of their investment philosophy may from time to
time require action which could be viewed as not completely
passive.  In order to avoid any question as to whether their
beneficial ownership is being reported on the proper form and in
order to provide greater investment flexibility and administra-
tive uniformity, these persons have decided to file their benefi-
cial ownership reports on the more detailed Schedule 13D form
rather than on the short-form Schedule 13G and thereby to provide
more expansive disclosure than may be necessary.

more of the following persons: Gabelli Funds, Inc. ("GFI"), GAMCO

mance Partnership L.P. ("GPP"), GLI, Inc. ("GLI"), Gabelli

          (d) and (e) -  On December 8, 1994, the SEC instituted 
and simultaneously accepted offers for the settlement of an
administrative proceeding against Gabelli & Company and GAMCO. 
The order instituting the proceeding included a finding, which
Gabelli & Company and GAMCO neither admitted nor denied, that
they failed to implement and maintain policies and procedures
reasonably designed to prevent the misuse of material, nonpublic
information by not specifically addressing the special circum-
stances that arose from their affiliation with Lynch Corporation,
a public company.  To resolve this matter, Gabelli & Company and
GAMCO agreed to cease and desist from violating Section 15(f) of
the 1934 Act and Section 204A of the Advisers Act, respectively. 
They further agreed to each pay a civil penalty in the amount of
$50,000, and to retain, and adopt the recommendations of, an
independant consultant regarding their Section 15(f) and Section
204A policies and procedures.  
     (f) - Reference is made to Schedule I hereto.

the Issuer and in that event, the Proxy Voting Committee of each of
the Funds shall respectively vote that Fund's shares, and except
that, at any time, the Proxy Voting Committee of each such Fund may
take and exercise in its sole discretion the entire voting power
with respect to the shares held by such Fund under special
circumstances such as regulatory considerations, and except that
the power of Mr. Gabelli and GFI is indirect with respect to
Securities beneficially owned directly by other Reporting Persons.

Securities which were effected during the past sixty days or since
the most recent filing on Schedule 13D, whichever is less, by each
of the Reporting Persons and Covered Persons is set forth on
