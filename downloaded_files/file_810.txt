Item 1.           Security and Issuer.

                  This statement relates to the Common Stock, par value $.01
per share (the "Common  Stock" or the  "Shares"),  of Hawaiian  Airlines,  Inc.
(the "Company"),  which has its principal  executive  offices at 3375 Koapaka
Street, Suite G-350, Honolulu, Hawaii 96819.

Item 2. Identity and Background.

                  This  statement  is  being  filed  by  Cumberland
Associates.  Cumberland  Associates is a limited partnership  organized under
the laws of the State  of  New  York,  and  is  engaged  in  the  business  of
managing,  on  a discretionary  basis,  ten  securities  accounts,  the
principal one of which is Cumberland  Partners.  The  address  of the
principal  business  and  office of Cumberland Associates is 1114 Avenue of the
Americas, New York, New York 10036.

                  K. Tucker Andersen, Richard Reiss, Jr., Oscar S. Schafer,
Bruce G. Wilcox, Glenn Krevlin, Andrew Wallach and Eleanor Poppe are the
general partners (the "General Partners") of Cumberland Associates.  The
business address of each of the General Partners is the same as that of
Cumberland Associates.  Each of the General Partners is a citizen of the United
States.

                  Neither Cumberland  Associates nor any of the General
Partners have,  during the last five  years,  been  convicted  in a  criminal
proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors), nor has any
such person, during the last five years,  been a party to a civil proceeding of
a judicial or administrative  body of  competent  jurisdiction  as a result  of
which any such person was or is subject to a judgment, decree or

<PAGE>4


final  order  enjoining  future  violations  of,  or  prohibiting  or
mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding
any violation with respect to such laws.

Item 3.  Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.

                  As  of  the  date  hereof,   Cumberland  Associates  held
and beneficially  owned  2,029,540  shares of Common Stock.  The aggregate
purchase price of the  Common  Stock  purchased  by  Cumberland  Associates  on
behalf of Cumberland  Partners,  LongView  Partners  and the other  managed
accounts  was $6,596,005.   Of  this  amount,  Cumberland  Associates  invested
approximately $4,884,978  on behalf of  Cumberland  Partners,  $778,277  on
behalf of LongView Partners and $932,750 on behalf of eight of Cumberland
Associates' other account holders.  The  source  of funds for the  purchase  of
all such  Common  Stock by Cumberland  Associates  was a combination of
investment  capital  contributed by Cumberland Partners,  LongView Partners and
the eight other managed accounts and margin borrowings  through the margin
accounts of the account holders maintained with Morgan Stanley & Co.
Incorporated.

                  By virtue of Rule 13d-3 under the  Securities  Exchange Act
of 1934 (the "Act") each of the General Partners may be deemed the beneficial
owner of all of the Common  Stock  purchased  by  Cumberland  Associates  on
behalf of Cumberland  Partners,  LongView  Partners and the other  managed
accounts,  and therefore  each General  Partner may be deemed to have  invested
the  aggregate amount of funds noted above. Except as noted above, none of the
General Partners has  independently  invested any of his funds for the purpose
of purchasing  the Common Stock.

Item 4.  Purpose of Transaction.

                  Cumberland   Associates  has  purchased,   on  behalf  of
its discretionary  accounts, the Common Stock in order to acquire an equity
interest in the Company.  As of the date hereof,  Cumberland  Associates  is
holding such Common Stock solely for investment and it has no present plans or
proposals with respect to any material change in the Company's business or
corporate  structure or,  generally,  any other action referred to in
instructions (a) through (j) of Item 4 of the form of Schedule  13D.  Depending
on market  conditions  and other factors,  Cumberland  Associates  may continue
purchases of Common Stock or may sell or otherwise dispose of all or portions
of such Common Stock, if such sales and purchases would be desirable
investments for the portfolios of its accounts.

Item 5. Interest in Securities of the Issuer.

                  As of the  date  hereof,  Cumberland  Associates
beneficially owned the aggregate number and percentage of outstanding  Common

filing.

                  In addition,  each of the General  Partners  may, by virtue
of his position as general partner of Cumberland Associates, be deemed,
pursuant to Rule  13d-3  under  the  Act,  to own  beneficially  the  Common
Stock of which Cumberland  Associates would possess beneficial  ownership.
Other than in their respective  capacities as general partners of Cumberland
Associates and as noted above, none of the General Partners is the beneficial
owner of any Common Stock.

         sole power to dispose or to direct the  disposition  of such  Shares;
         as to 287,000 Shares of which,  there is shared voting power and
         shared power to dispose or to direct the  disposition  of such  Shares
         because  the eight other  account  holders may be deemed  beneficial
         owners of such Shares  pursuant to Rule 13d-3 under the Act as a
         result of their right to terminate their discretionary accounts within
         a period of 60 days.

2        Based on the sum of (i) 26,409,421 shares of Common Stock
         outstanding, as indicated in the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarterly

accounts except Cumberland Partners and LongView Partners, Cumberland
Associates receives (i) an  annual  management  fee from  some of its  account
holders  and (ii) an incentive fee from all of its account  holders based, in

income during the preceding fiscal or calendar  year. In the case of the
accounts of Cumberland  Partners and LongView Partners, Cumberland Associates
received an annual management fee from each such account holders which does not
include an incentive fee.

                  Except as otherwise set forth in this  statement,  to the
best knowledge   of  the   undersigned,   there  are  no   contracts,
arrangements, understandings  or  relationships  (legal or  otherwise)  among
