Item 1.  Security and Issuer.

                  This  Amendment  No. 3, which is being filed  pursuant to Rule
13d-2 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities  Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the "Exchange  Act"),  amends the Schedule 13D, filed December
8, 1995,  as amended by Amendment  No. 1 thereto,  filed  February 13, 1996,  as
amended by Amendment No. 2 thereto, filed July 18, 1996 (the "Schedule 13D"), of
Cumberland Associates, a New York limited partnership, and relates to the Common
Stock,  par value $.01 per share (the "Common Stock" or the "Shares"),  of Orion
Network Systems, Inc. (the "Company"), which has its principal executive offices
at 2440  Research  Boulevard,  Suite  400,  Rockville,  Maryland  20850.  Unless
otherwise  indicated,  all capitalized  terms used herein but not defined herein
shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Schedule 13D.

Item 2.  Identity and Background.

                  Item 2 of the Schedule  13D is hereby  amended and restated in
its entirety to read as follows:

                  This  statement  is  being  filed  by  Cumberland  Associates.
Cumberland  Associates is a limited partnership  organized under the laws of the
State  of  New  York,  and  is  engaged  in  the  business  of  managing,  on  a
discretionary basis, eleven securities  accounts,  the principal one of which is
Cumberland  Partners.  The  address  of the  principal  business  and  office of
Cumberland

<PAGE>


Associates is 1114 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10036.

                  K. Tucker  Andersen,  Gary Tynes,  Oscar S. Schafer,  Bruce G.
Wilcox, Glenn Krevlin, Andrew Wallach and Eleanor Poppe are the general partners
(the "General Partners") of Cumberland Associates.  The business address of each
of the General  Partners is the same as that of Cumberland  Associates.  Each of
the General Partners is a citizen of the United States.

                  Neither Cumberland  Associates nor any of the General Partners
have,  during the last five  years,  been  convicted  in a  criminal  proceeding
(excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors), nor has any such person,
during the last five years,  been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or
administrative  body of  competent  jurisdiction  as a result  of which any such
person was or is subject to a judgment,  decree or final order enjoining  future
violations  of, or prohibiting  or mandating  activities  subject to, federal or
state  securities  laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws.

Item 3. Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.

                  Item 3 of the Schedule  13D is hereby  amended and restated in
its entirety to read as follows:

                  As  of  the  date  hereof,   Cumberland  Associates  held  and
beneficially  owned 430,300 shares of Common Stock. The aggregate purchase price
of the Common Stock  purchased by Cumberland  Associates on behalf of Cumberland
Partners, LongView Partners

<PAGE>


and the other  managed  accounts  was  $3,276,500.  Of this  amount,  Cumberland
Associates invested  approximately  $2,362,193 on behalf of Cumberland Partners,
$537,358  on behalf  of  LongView  Partners  and  $376,949  on behalf of five of
Cumberland  Associates'  other  account  holders.  The  source  of funds for the
purchase of all such Common Stock of Cumberland  Associates was a combination of
investment capital contributed by Cumberland Partners, LongView Partners and the
five other managed accounts and margin borrowings through the margin accounts of
the account holders maintained with Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated.

                  By virtue of Rule 13d-3 under the  Exchange  Act,  each of the
General  Partners may be deemed the beneficial  owner of all of the Common Stock
purchased by Cumberland  Associates on behalf of Cumberland  Partners,  LongView
Partners and the other managed accounts,  and therefore each General Partner may
be deemed to have  invested the aggregate  amount of funds noted above.  None of
the General Partners has independently  invested any of his or her funds for the
purpose of purchasing  the Common  Stock.  

Item 5. Interest in Securities of the Issuer.

                  Item 5 of the Schedule  13D is hereby  amended and restated in
its entirety to read as follows:

                  As of the  date  hereof,  Cumberland  Associates  beneficially
owned 430,300(1) shares of Common Stock representing 3.9%(2) of the Common Stock
deemed outstanding on the date hereof.

- -------------------------------
(1)      As to  381,900  Shares of which,  there is sole  voting  power and sole
         power to dispose or to direct the  disposition  of such  Shares;  as to
         48,400  Shares of which,  there is shared voting power and shared power
         to dispose or to direct the disposition of such Shares because the five
         other account  holders may be deemed  beneficial  owners of such Shares
         pursuant  to Rule  13d-3  under the Act as a result  of their  right to
         terminate their discretionary accounts within a period of 60 days.

(2)      Based on 11,175,076 shares of Common Stock outstanding, as indicated in
         the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 1997.

<PAGE>


                  Set forth in  Appendix  A  attached  hereto  and  incorporated
herein by reference are  descriptions  of the  transactions  in the Common Stock
effected by Cumberland  Associates  within the period beginning on July 19, 1996
through the date of this filing.

                  In addition,  each of the General  Partners  may, by virtue of
his position as general partner of Cumberland Associates, be deemed, pursuant to
Rule  13d-3  under  the  Act,  to own  beneficially  the  Common  Stock of which
Cumberland  Associates would possess beneficial  ownership.  Other than in their
respective capacities as general partners of Cumberland Associates,  none of the
General Partners is the beneficial owner of any Common Stock.

                  As of the date hereof,  Cumberland Associates is no longer the
beneficial  owner  of more  than 5  percent  of the  Common  Stock  outstanding.
Accordingly,  until such time as  Cumberland  Associates  acquires,  directly or
indirectly,  beneficial  ownership of additional Common Stock in excess of the 5
percent  threshold,  Cumberland  Associates  is no  longer  required  to  report
pursuant to Rule 13d-1 with respect to the Common Stock.

Item 6. Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships with Respect to
        Securities of the Issuer.

                  Item 6 of the Schedule  13D is hereby  amended and restated in
its entirety to read as follows:

                  Pursuant to  management  agreements  with all of its  accounts
except  Cumberland  Partners,  LongView  Partners  and  LongView  B,  Cumberland
Associates  receives  (i) an  annual  management  fee from  some of its  account
holders and (ii) an incentive fee from all of its account  holders based, in the
case  of  some of the  account  holders,  on the  net  appreciation  during  the
preceding  fiscal or calendar year in the value of the securities in the account
and, in the case of other  account  holders,  on the  account's  taxable  income
during the  preceding  fiscal or calendar  year.  In the case of the accounts of
Cumberland  Partners,  LongView  Partners and Longview B, Cumberland  Associates
receives an annual  management fee from each such account holders which does not
include an incentive fee.

                  Except as otherwise set forth in this  statement,  to the best
knowledge   of  the   undersigned,   there  are  no   contracts,   arrangements,
understandings  or  relationships  (legal or  otherwise)  among or  between  the
undersigned,  the General  Partners  and any other  person  with  respect to any
securities  of the Company,  including  but not limited to transfer or voting of
any  of  the  securities,   finder's  fees,  joint  ventures,   loan  or  option
arrangements, puts or calls, guarantees of profits, division of profits or loss,
or the giving or withholding of proxies.

                  After reasonable  inquiry and to the best knowledge and belief
of the undersigned,  the undersigned certifies that the information set forth in
this statement is true, complete and correct.
