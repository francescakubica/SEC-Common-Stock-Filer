deemed to be members of a group comprised of Tweedy, Browne Company  L.P.
("TBC"),  TBK Partners, L.P. ("TBK") and Vanderbilt Partners, L.P.
("Vanderbilt"), which group may be deemed to be the beneficial owner in the

prompted by an examination by the filing persons on October 28, 1995 of the
Issuer's Proxy Statement dated March 2, 1995.   However, the filing of this
Amendment  should not be deemed an admission that TBC, TBK and Vanderbilt
comprise a group within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities and

ITEM 3.  SOURCE AND AMOUNT OF FUNDS OR OTHER CONSIDERATION

         As of the date hereof, the number of shares with respect to which TBC
may be deemed to be the beneficial owner is 674,476 shares of Common Stock (the
"TBC Shares"), all of which shares were purchased in open market transactions.
The aggregate cost of the TBC Shares, including brokerage commissions, was
$6,888,543.

         The TBC Shares are held in the TBC Accounts, the funds therefor coming
from the funds on hand in each individual managed account and in certain
instances from standard margin account borrowings from brokerage accounts
maintained at Fleet Clearing Corporation.  It is expected that funds used by
the TBC Accounts to purchase additional shares of Common Stock, if additional
shares are purchased by the TBC Accounts (see Item 4 hereof), will come from
the funds on hand for each individual managed account, which funds on hand at
any time and from time to time may include, among others, funds borrowed
pursuant to margin accounts maintained at Fleet Clearing Corporation.
Borrowings made by certain TBC Accounts pursuant to such margin accounts are
secured by margin securities owned by the respective accounts, including some
of the TBC Shares.  Interest on outstanding borrowings under such margin
accounts ranges from 1/2% to 2% over the brokers' call rate in effect from time
to time at Chemical Bank, New York, New York, depending upon the amount of
outstanding borrowings at any given time.

         As of the date hereof, TBK beneficially owns directly 20,000 shares of
Common Stock (the "TBK Shares"), all of which shares were purchased in open
market transactions.  The aggregate cost  of the TBK Shares, including
brokerage commissions, was $193,911.





                                        
<PAGE>   7


         It is expected that funds used by TBK to purchase additional shares of
Common Stock, if additional shares are purchased by TBK (see Item 4 hereof),
will come from TBK's general funds, which include cash and cash equivalents on
hand and in banks.

         TBK's general funds have included, and it is expected that they will
from time to time include, funds borrowed by it pursuant to an understanding
with Chemical Bank.  As of the date hereof, TBK has a loan outstanding with
Chemical Bank in the amount of $20,000.00.  Borrowings made by TBK pursuant to
that understanding bear interest at the brokers' call rate in effect from time
to time at Chemical Bank. TBK's funds on hand have also included, and it is
expected that they will from time to time include, funds borrowed by it
pursuant to an understanding with The Bank of New York, New York, New York.
Pursuant to that understanding, TBK may borrow funds at the brokers' call rate
charged from time to time by The Bank of New York.  As of the date hereof, TBK
has a loan outstanding with The Bank of New York in the amount of $10,000.00.
Borrowings made by TBK pursuant to its understandings with Chemical Bank and
The Bank of New York are secured by securities owned by TBK; such borrowings
are not secured by any TBK Shares.  No borrowings from Chemical Bank or The
Bank of New York were made for the purpose of acquiring the TBK Shares.  TBK
reserves the right to include all or any of the shares of Common Stock owned by
it at any time or from time to time, among the securities that serve as
collateral for such borrowings, subject to compliance with any applicable
statutes and regulations.

         As of the date hereof, Vanderbilt beneficially owns directly 12,300
shares of Common Stock (the "Vanderbilt Shares"), all of which shares were
purchased in open market transactions.  The aggregate cost of the Vanderbilt
Shares, including brokerage commissions, was $129,519.

         It is expected that funds used by Vanderbilt to purchase additional
shares of Common Stock, if additional shares are purchased by Vanderbilt (see
Item 4 hereof), will come from Vanderbilt's general funds, which include cash
and cash equivalents on hand and in banks.

         Vanderbilt's general funds have included, and it is expected that they
will from time to time include, funds borrowed by it pursuant to an
understanding with Chemical Bank.  No borrowings from Chemical Bank were made
by Vanderbilt for the purpose of acquiring the Vanderbilt Shares.  Vanderbilt
reserves the right to include all or any of the shares of Common Stock owned by
it at any time or from time to time, among the securities that serve as
collateral for such borrowings, subject to compliance with any applicable
statutes and regulations.

ITEM 4.  PURPOSE OF TRANSACTION

         Each of TBC, TBK and Vanderbilt has acquired the shares of Common
Stock owned by it for investment purposes and for none of the reasons
enumerated in Item 4 of Schedule 13D, except that TBC, TBK and Vanderbilt may
dispose of all or some of the TBC Shares, the TBK Shares and the Vanderbilt
Shares, respectively, or may acquire additional shares of Common Stock from
time to time, depending upon price and market conditions, evaluation of
alternative investments, and other factors.  Currently, TBC, TBK and Vanderbilt
intend to acquire additional shares of Common Stock in the open market,
depending upon the price of the Common Stock from time to time.

         (a)  As of the date hereof, TBC may be deemed to be the beneficial
owner of an aggregate of 674,476 shares of Common Stock, which constitutes

particular General Partner or Thomas P. Knapp.

         Each of TBC, TBK and Vanderbilt disclaims beneficial ownership of
