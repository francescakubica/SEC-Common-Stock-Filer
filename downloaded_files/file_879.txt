            Item 1.  Security and Issuer.

            This Amendment No. 1, dated July 26, 1995 (this "Amendment"),
to the Statement on Schedule 13D, dated June 9, 1993 (the "Original
Statement"), filed by Philips Electronics N.V., a corporation organized
under the laws of The Netherlands ("Philips"), relates to the common stock,
par value $0.25 per share (the "Common Stock"), of Fluke Corporation,
formerly known as John Fluke Mfg. Co., Inc. (the "Issuer").  The address of
the principal executive offices of the Issuer are located at 6920 Seaway
Boulevard, Everett, Washington 98203.

            Item 2.  Identity and Background.

            (a) - (c); (f).  This statement is being filed by Philips, a
Netherlands corporation.  Philips acts as the holding company of the
Philips group.  The Philips group is engaged primarily in the manufacture
and distribution of electronic and electrical products, systems and
equipment.  The principal office and business address of Philips is
Groenewoudseweg 1, 5621 BA, Eindhoven, The Netherlands.  Philips is
sometimes referred to herein as the "Reporting Person."

            Attached as Schedule I hereto and incorporated by reference
herein is a list of the members of the Supervisory Board and the members of
the Board of Management and the Group Management Committee of Philips. 
Schedule I sets forth each of such persons' name, business address, present
principal occupation or employment and citizenship, and the name, principal
business and address of the corporation or other organization in which such
employment is conducted.

            (d) and (e).  During the last five years, the Reporting Person
and, to the knowledge of the Reporting Person, none of the persons listed
on Schedule I attached hereto, has been convicted in a criminal proceeding
(excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or was a party to a
civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent
jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a
judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or
prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, Federal or State securities
laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws.

            Item 3.  Source and Amount of Funds or Other
                      Consideration.

            Philips acquired 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock of the Issuer
in part consideration of the sale of Philips' Test and Measurement Business
to the Issuer.  At the same time, Philips acquired a further 538,144 shares
of Common Stock upon conversion 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 4

of 78,462 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock of the Issuer which 
were acquired in September, 1987.


            Item 4.  Purpose of Transaction.

            Philips acquired the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned
by it for the purpose of investment.  Except as otherwise indicated in this
Item 4, Philips has no plan or proposals with respect to the Issuer that
relate to or could result in any of the actions specified in clauses (a)
through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D.

            Philips intends to review on a continuing basis its investment
in the issuer and, subject to the terms and conditions of the Stock
Purchase Agreement dated May 26, 1993 (the "Stock Purchase Agreement")
annexed to the Purchase Agreement, dated February 26, 1993, which was filed
as Exhibit I to the Original Statement, may increase or decrease such
investment.  Philips has agreed, pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement,
to standstill arrangements and other restrictions and Philips may only sell
such Common Stock pursuant to certain quantity and timing limitations. 
Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Issuer has the right of first
refusal to purchase any shares offered for sale by Philips.

            Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, Philips
is entitled to designate two individuals to the Board of Directors of the
Issuer, so long as the Common Stock beneficially owned by Philips exceeds
12% of the Issuer's outstanding Common Stock.  If, at any time, Philips'
interest in the Common Stock drops below 12%, Philips shall cause one of
the two Directors so designated to immediately offer to resign from the
Board of Directors of the Issuer.  If the Common Stock beneficially owned
by Philips drops below 6% of the Issuer's outstanding Common Stock, Philips
has agreed to cause the remaining Director designated by Philips to
immediately offer to resign from the Board of Directors of the Issuer. 
Currently Mr. Tumminello, the Chief Executive Offer of North American
Philips Corporation, and Dr. J. Peter Bingham, the President of Philips
Laboratories in the U.S., are the Directors designated by Philips.  

            Item 5.  Interest in Securities of the Issuer.

            (a) and (b).  Philips beneficially owns 1,138,144 shares
(14.4%) of the Common Stock of the Issuer.  Philips is deemed to have sole
voting and dispositive power over 1,138,144 shares of such Common Stock.

            (c).  On May 26, 1993, in part consideration for the sale of
its Test and Measurement business, Philips received 1,000,000 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 5

shares of Common Stock of the Issuer pursuant to the Stock Purchase 
Agreement.  In addition, pursuant to a stock purchase agreement entered 
into in September, 1987, Philips acquired 78,462 shares of Series A 
Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Preferred Stock") of the Issuer which, 
upon the occurrence of certain events, are convertible into Common Stock.  
Although no event permitting conversion had occurred, on May 26, 1993, 
pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Issuer permitted Philips 
to convert its 78,462 shares of Preferred Stock into 538,144 shares
of Common Stock.  As previously reported by the Issuer in its 1994 proxy
statement, on June 24, 1994, pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase
Agreement (as defined below) the Issuer exercised its right of first
refusal to purchase 150,000 shares of Common Stock from Philips for
$4.6 million (approximately $30.53 per share).  Pursuant to the Stock
Purchase Agreement, dated as of June 16, 1995 (the "Electris Agreement"),
by and between Philips and Electris Finance, S.A., a Luxembourg company and
wholly owned subsidiary of Philips ("Electris"), on June 19, 1995 Philips
sold 250,000 shares of Common Stock to Electris for $10 million ($40.00 per
share).  The Issuer had previously failed to exercise its right of first
refusal with respect to such shares of Common Stock.  A copy of the
Electris Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit II and is incorporated by
reference herein.  Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of
June 26, 1995 (the "Sedifo Agreement"), by and between Electris and Sedifo
S.A., a Swiss company ("Sedifo"), on June 30, 1995 Electris sold 250,000
shares of Common Stock to Sedifo for approximately $10.4 million ($41.75
per share).  A copy of the Sedifo Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit
III and is incorporated by reference herein.

            Item 6.  Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or
                      Relationships with Respect to Securities of
                      the Issuer.

            Standstill Arrangements.  Pursuant to the Stock Purchase
Agreement, Philips has agreed to a standstill agreement in which neither
Philips nor any entity in which Philips has a 50% or greater ownership
interest can increase Philips' aggregate voting power above the percentage
controlled by Philips immediately following the closing of the purchase
transaction.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Philips' percentage aggregate
voting power may exceed such maximum percentage if the increase of
percentage is a result of an acquisition of stock by the Issuer which, by
reducing the number of shares outstanding increases the proportionate
number of shares beneficially owned by Philips.

            Philips is also subject to limitations on the amount of and the
manner in which it may dispose of the shares of Common Stock, as detailed
in the Stock Purchase Agreement.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 6

            No Inducement of Change of Control.  Philips has also agreed
not to directly or indirectly initiate, induce, encourage or assist any
person in any plan, proposal or other effort to purchase or offer to
purchase the Issuer or control of the Issuer, or cause the sale of the
Issuer or control of the Issuer in opposition to the recommendation of the
majority of the Board of Directors.  Such restriction shall not be deemed
to restrict Philips' right to vote the shares of Common Stock otherwise
permitted in the Stock Purchase Agreement.

            Registration Rights.  The Stock Purchase Agreement provides
that, upon written request of Philips, the Issuer will register the shares
of Common Stock acquired by Philips in the event that the Issuer chooses
not to exercise its right of first refusal.  If Philips has otherwise sold
shares pursuant to an unregistered offering as provided in the Stock
Purchase Agreement, such purchaser may also elect to have such shares
covered by the registration statement.
