ITEM 3            SOURCE AND AMOUNT OF FUNDS OR OTHER CONSIDERATION

                  As of the date hereof, Schroder Wertheim beneficially owns
                  254,000 shares of Common Stock acquired for an aggregate
                  consideration of $7,440,722.  Such shares are held in
                  accounts of its customers managed by Schroder Wertheim as
                  well as Schroder Wertheim's own accounts.  Schroder
                  Wertheim's customers include investment partnerships in
                  which Schroder Wertheim serves as general partner and in
                  which Schroder Wertheim has a pecuniary interest.  The funds
                  for the purchase of shares of Common Stock owned by accounts
                  managed by Schroder Wertheim have come from their owners. 
                  The funds for the purchase of shares of Common Stock owned
                  by Schroder Wertheim are obtained from

                             Page 3 of 9 Pages

<PAGE>

                  Schroder Wertheim's working capital.  Schroder Wertheim's
                  working capital may, at any given time, include funds
                  borrowed in the ordinary course of its ongoing general
                  business activities.

ITEM 4            PURPOSE OF THE TRANSACTION

                  The shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by Schroder
                  Wertheim were acquired solely for investment purposes.

                  Schroder Wertheim has no intention or plans to affect or
                  influence the control of the Company, but is filing this
                  Schedule 13D because a portion of the holdings reported
                  herein were acquired through Schroder Wertheim's risk
                  arbitrage activities in its proprietary accounts and as such
                  may be deemed by interpretation of the Securities and
                  Exchange Commission to be made in connection with a
                  transaction having the effect of changing control of the
                  Company.

                  Schroder Wertheim does not have any present plan or
                  proposals which relate to, or would result in any of the
                  actions specified in clauses (a) through (j) of Schedule 13D
                  under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

                  Additional shares may be acquired and any or all such shares
                  may be disposed of at any time or from time to time, in each
                  case depending on market conditions.

ITEM 5            INTEREST IN SECURITIES OF THE ISSUER

                  Schroder Wertheim may be deemed to beneficially own 254,000
                  shares of the Common Stock of the Company, representing
                  approximately 7.8% of the outstanding shares.  A portion of
                  such shares are held in the accounts of various customers of
                  Schroder Wertheim, with respect to which accounts the
                  Reporting Person has shared investment and sole voting
                  discretion.  For information with respect to the power to
                  vote or direct the vote and the power to dispose or direct
                  the disposition of the Common Stock deemed to be
                  beneficially owned by Schroder Wertheim, see Rows 7-10 of
                  the cover page.  Schroder Wertheim disclaims that it is the
                  beneficial owner of any of the shares held in its customers'
                  accounts, except to the extent Schroder Wertheim has a
                  pecuniary beneficial interest in the investment partnerships
                  for which it serves as general partner and investment
                  adviser.  To the best knowledge of Schroder Wertheim, each
                  of the persons maintaining an account with Schroder Wertheim
                  has the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt
                  of dividends and/or interests from, or the proceeds from the
                  sale of, the shares of Common Stock held in such person's
                  account.
