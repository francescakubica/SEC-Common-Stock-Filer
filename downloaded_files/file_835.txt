The reason for the filing of this Amendment No. 1 to the
previously filed Schedule 13D is to show that the holdings of
Kingdon Capital Management Corporation ("KCMC") in the shares of
Common Stock (the "Common Stock") of Insite Vision Incorporated
("INSR") increased by more than 1% of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock on April 17, 1996.  KCMC is currently deemed to be
the beneficial owner of 5.73% of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock of INSR, which constitutes less than a 1% change since the
filing of the original Schedule 13D.

Item 1.  Security and Issuer

         No change.

Item 2.  Identity and Background

         No change.

Item 3.  Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.

         As of the date hereof, KCMC is deemed to beneficially
         own 749,000 shares of INSR Common Stock (including
         125,000 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
         warrants expiring on January 24, 2001 which may be
         exercised at a price of $3.25 per share (the
         "Warrants")).  All 749,000 shares of Common Stock
         (including 125,000 share issuable upon exercise of the
         Warrants) are held by entities and managed accounts over
         which KCMC has investment discretion.  The shares
         purchased since the original filing on Schedule 13D were
         purchased in an open-market transaction for a price of
         $1,000,000.  The funds for the purchase of the Common
         Stock and Warrants held in the entities and managed
         accounts over which KCMC has investment discretion have
         come from each entity's or account's own funds.  No
         leverage was used to purchase any Common Stock and
         Warrants.

Item 4.  Purpose of Transactions.

         No change.

Item 5.  Interest in Securities of Issuer.

         As of the date hereof, KCMC is deemed to be the
         beneficial owner of 749,000 shares of INSR Common Stock
         (including 125,000 shares issuable upon exercise of the
         Warrants).  Based on information received from XOMD,
         KCMC believes there to be 12,937,000 shares of INSR
         Common Stock outstanding.  Therefore, KCMC is deemed to
         beneficially own 5.73% of the outstanding shares of
         Common Stock.  KCMC has the sole power to vote, direct
         the vote, dispose of or direct the disposition of all
         the shares of Common Stock that it is currently deemed
         to beneficially own.

Item 6.  Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or
         Relationships with Respect to Securities of the Issuer

         No change.

Item 7.  Material to be Filed as Exhibits.

         Attached hereto as Exhibit A is a description of the
         transactions in the Common Stock that were effected by
         KCMC since the last filing on Schedule 13D.

    Signature

         The undersigned, after reasonable inquiry and to the
         best of its knowledge and belief, certifies that the
         information set forth in this statement is true,
         complete and correct.
