Item 1.   Security and Issuer

          The class of equity security to which this statement on
form Schedule 13D relates is the Class A Common Stock, par value
$1.00 per share ("Securities"), of  Contel Cellular Inc., (the
"Issuer"), a Delaware  corporation, with principal offices
located at 245 Perimeter Center Parkway, Atlanta, Georgia, 30346. 
     

Item 2.   Identity and Background
          This statement is being filed by Mario J. Gabelli ("Mr.
Gabelli") and various entities which he directly or indirectly
controls and for which he acts as chief investment officer. 
These entities, except for Lynch Corporation ("Lynch"), Spinnaker
Industries, Incorporated ("Spinnaker", formerly known as Safety
Railway Services Corporation), Western New Mexico Telephone
Company ("Western New Mexico") and Inter-Community Telephone
Company ("Inter-Community") engage in various aspects of the
securities business, primarily as investment advisor to various
institutional and individual clients, including registered
investment companies and pension plans, as broker/dealer and as
managing general partner of various private investment partner-
ships.  Certain of these entities may also make investments for
their own account. 
          The foregoing persons in the aggregate often own
beneficially more than 5% of a class of equity securities of a
particular Issuer.  Although several of the foregoing persons are
treated as institutional investors for purposes of reporting
their beneficial ownership on the short-form Schedule 13G, the
holdings of those who do not qualify as institutional investors
may exceed the 1% threshold presented for filing on Schedule 13D
or implementation of their investment philosophy may from time to
time require action which could be viewed as not completely
passive.  In order to avoid any question as to whether their
beneficial ownership is being reported on the proper form and in
order to provide greater investment flexibility and administra-
tive uniformity, these persons have decided to file their benefi-
cial ownership reports on the more detailed Schedule 13D form
rather than on the short-form Schedule 13G and thereby to provide
more expansive disclosure than may be necessary. 
          (a), (b) and (c) - This statement is being filed by one
or more of the following persons: Gabelli Funds, Inc. ("GFI"),
GAMCO Investors, Inc. ("GAMCO"), Gabelli Securities, Inc. ("GS-
I"), Gabelli & Company, Inc. ("Gabelli & Company"), Gabelli

          For information required by instruction C to Schedule
13D with respect to the executive officers and directors of the
foregoing entities and other related persons (collectively,
"Covered Persons"), reference is made to Schedule I annexed
hereto and incorporated herein by reference. 
          (d) and (e) On December 8, 1994, the SEC instituted and
simultaneously accepted offers for the settlement of an adminis-
trative proceeding againts Gabelli & Company, Inc.  The order
instituting the proceeding included a finding, which Gabelli &
Company and GAMCO neither admitted nor denied, that they failed
to impliment and maintain policies and procedures reasonably
designed to prevent the misuse of material, nonpublic information
by not sepecifically addressing the special circumstances that
arose from their affiliation with Lynch Corporation, a public
company.  To resolve this matter, Gabelli & Company and GAMCO
agreed to cease and desist from violating Section 15(f) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and Section
204A of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"),
respectively.  They further agreed to each pay a civil penalty in
the amount of $50,000, and to retain, and adopt the recommenda-
tions of, an independant consultant regarding their Section 15(f)
and Section 204A policies and procedures.  
          On December 13, 1991, the Virginia State Corporation
Commission entered an order of settlement in final disposition of
matters arising from an allegation that GAMCO had transacted
business in Virginia as an investment adviser without having been
registered as such under Virginia Code Section 13.1-504A or an
exemption therefrom.  GAMCO consented to the entry of the order
without admitting or denying the allegation and without a hear-
ing.  The terms of the order provide that GAMCO would pay a fine
and cots totalling fifty-five thousand dollars and would not
transact business in Virginia as an investment adviser unless it
was registered as such under section 13.1-504A or was exempt from
registration.  
     (f) - Reference is made to Schedule I hereto. 

Item 3.   Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration
          All Reporting Persons used an aggregate of approximate-
ly $30,442,362 to purchase its Securities.  GAMCO and GFI used
approximately $13,608,304 and $6,368,690, respectively, of funds
that were provided through the accounts of certain of their
investment advisory clients (and, in the case of some of such
accounts at GAMCO, may be through borrowings from client margin
accounts) in order to purchase the Securities for such clients. 
ALCE used approximately $248,725 of the investment funds of the
partnership to purchase the Securities reported by it. The Plan
used approximately $1,979,250 of funds from the Plan's assets to
purchase the Securities reported by it.  Gabelli Associates used
approximately $7,762,275 of the investing funds of the Partner-
ship to purchase the Securites reported by it. GAL used approxi-
mately $450,223 of working capital to purchase the Securities
reported by it.  Gabelli & Company used $24,895 to purchase the
Securities for its own account.

Item 4.   Purpose of Transaction
          Each of the Reporting Persons, with the exceptions of
Lynch and Spinnaker, has purchased and holds the Securities
reported by it for investment for one or more accounts over which
it has shared, sole, or both investment and/or voting power, for
its own account, or both.  Technical difficulties with the
reporting of outstanding shares of the Class A stock of the
Issuer by the Reporting Persons' data retrieval system prevented
until now the ability to accurately determine when the aggregate
percentage of the outstanding shares beneficially owned by the
Reporting Persons exceeded the 5%.
          The Reporting Persons, with the exceptions of Lynch and
Spinnaker, are engaged in the business of securities analysis and
investment and pursue an investment philosophy of identifying
undervalued situations.  In pursuing this investment philosophy,
the Reporting Persons analyze the operations, capital structure
and markets of companies in which they invest, including the
Issuer, on a continuous basis through analysis of documentation
and discussions with knowledgeable industry and market observers
and with representatives of such companies (often at the invita-
tion of management). The Reporting Persons do not believe they
possess material inside information concerning the Issuer.  As a
result of these analytical activities one or more of the Report-
ing Persons may issue analysts reports, participate in interviews
or hold discussions with third parties or with management in
which the Reporting Person may suggest or take a position with
respect to potential changes in the operations, management or
capital structure of such companies as a means of enhancing
shareholder values. Such suggestions or positions may relate to
one or more of the transactions specified in clauses (a) through
(j) of Item 4 of the Schedule 13D form, including, without
limitation, such matters as disposing of one or more businesses,
selling the company or acquiring another company or business,
changing operating or marketing strategies, adopting or not
adopting, certain types of anti-takeover measures and restructur-
ing the company's capitalization or dividend policy. 
          Each of the Reporting Persons intends to adhere to the
foregoing investment philosophy with respect to the Issuer.  How-
ever, none of the Reporting Persons intends to seek control of
the Issuer or participate in the management of the Issuer, and
any Reporting Person that is registered as an investment company
under the l940 Act will participate in such a transaction only
following receipt of an exemption from the SEC under Rule l7D-l
under the l940 Act, if required, and in accordance with other
applicable law. In pursuing this investment philosophy, each
Reporting Person will continuously assess the Issuer's business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects, general
economic conditions, the securities markets in general and those
for the Issuer's securities in particular, other developments and
other investment opportunities, as well as the investment objec-
tives and diversification requirements of its shareholders or
clients and its fiduciary duties to such shareholders or clients. 
Depending on such assessments, one or more of the Reporting
Persons may acquire additional Securities or may determine to
sell or otherwise dispose of all or some of its holdings of
Securities.  Although the Reporting Persons share the same basic
investment philosophy and although portfolio decisions are made
by or under the supervision of Mr. Gabelli, the investment
objectives and diversification requirements of various clients
differ from those of other clients so that one or more Reporting
Persons may be acquiring Securities while others are disposing of
Securities.
          With respect to voting of the Securities, the Reporting
Persons have adopted general voting policies relating to voting
on specified issues affecting corporate governance and sharehold-
er values.  Under these policies, the Reporting Persons generally
vote all securities over which they have voting power in favor of
cumulative voting, financially reasonable golden parachutes, one
share one vote, management cash incentives and pre-emptive rights
and against greenmail, poison pills, supermajority voting, blank
check preferred stock and super-dilutive stock options.  Excep-
tions may be made when management otherwise demonstrates superior
sensitivity to the needs of shareholders.  In the event that the
aggregate voting position of all joint filers shall exceed 25% of
the total voting position of the issuer then the proxy voting
committees of The Gabelli Equity Trust, The Gabelli Value Fund,
and The Gabelli Asset Fund shall vote their funds shares indepen-
dently.
          Each of the Covered Persons who is not a Reporting
Person has purchased the Securities reported herein as benefi-
cially owned by him for investment for his own account or that of
one or more members of his immediate family. Each such person may
acquire additional Securities or dispose of some or all of the
Securities reported herein with respect to him. 
          Other than as described above, none of the Reporting
Persons and none of the Covered Persons who is not a Reporting
Person has any present plans or proposals which relate to or
would result in any transaction, change or event specified in
clauses (a) through (j) of Item 4 of the Schedule 13D form. 
          Gabelli-Rosenthal & Partners, L.P. ("G-R"), a partner-
ship for whose general partner GLI, Inc., which is an indirect
subsidiary of GFI, acts as the monitor of existing portfolio
investments and this is its primary business purpose.

          Mr. Gabelli is deemed to have beneficial ownership of the
Securities beneficially owned by each of the foregoing persons and
GFI is deemed to have beneficial ownership of the securities owned
beneficially by each of the foregoing persons other than Mr.
Gabelli. 
          (b) Each of the Reporting Persons and Covered Persons has
the sole power to vote or direct the vote and sole power to dispose
or to direct the disposition of the Securities reported for it,
either for its own benefit or for the benefit of its investment
clients or its partners, as the case may be, except that GAMCO
Investors, Inc. does not have authority to vote 27,000 of the
reported shares and except that GFI has sole dispositive and voting

Global Multimedia Trust Inc., The Gabelli Global Convertible
Securities Fund and/or The Gabelli Global Interactive Couch Potato
Fund, so long as the aggregate voting interest of all joint filers
does not exceed 25% of their total voting interest in the Issuer
and in that event, the Proxy Voting Committee of each Fund (other
than The Gabelli Growth Fund) shall respectively vote that Funds
shares, and except that, at any time, the Proxy Voting Committee of
each such Fund may take and exercise in its sole discretion the
entire voting power with respect to the shares held by such Fund
under special circumstances such as regulatory considerations, and
except that the power of Mr. Gabelli and GFI is indirect with
respect to Securities beneficially owned directly by other
Reporting Persons. 
          (c) Information with respect to all transactions in the
Securities which were effected during the past sixty days by each
of the Reporting Persons and Covered Persons is set forth on
Schedule II annexed hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
          (d) The investment advisory and brokerage clients of GFI,
GAMCO, Gabelli & Company, the partners of the various partnerships
