     E.   Proceedings.
          -----------

          During the last five years none of the Reporting Persons
nor, to the best knowledge of the Reporting Persons, the  executive
officers, directors or controlling persons of any Reporting Person
have been convicted in any criminal proceeding (excluding traffic
violations or similar misdemeanors) or have been parties to any
civil, judicial or administrative proceeding as a result of which
any Reporting Person or such executive officer, director or
controlling person was or is subject to any judgment, decree or
final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or
mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws
or finding any violation with respect to such laws.

Item 3.   Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.
- ------    -------------------------------------------------

          The Shares herein reported as being beneficially owned by
the Reporting Persons were acquired as follows:

          (1)  Acting on behalf of Value Fund, PCB purchased a
     total of 658,800 Shares in open market transactions for an
     aggregate consideration (exclusive of brokers' commissions)
     of $4,084,363.00.  To the best knowledge of the Reporting
     Persons, the funds used in such purchases were from Value
     Fund's existing available investment capital and none of the
     consideration for such Shares was represented by borrowed
     funds.

          (2)  Acting on behalf of Cundill Security Fund, a trust
     company incorporated under the laws of Canada ("Security
     Fund"), PCB purchased a total of 32,500 Shares in open market
     transactions for an aggregate consideration (exclusive of
     brokers' commissions) of $203,125.00.  To the best knowledge
     of the Reporting Persons, the funds used in such purchases
     were from existing available investment capital and none of
     the consideration for such Shares was represented by borrowed
     funds.

     Individually neither PCB nor Security Fund beneficially own 5%
or more of the Shares.  Due to the investment management services
provided by PCB to Value Fund and Security Fund, PCB could be
deemed a beneficial owner of all Shares purchased in the
transaction described in subitems (1) and (2) above.

     All dollar amounts are in United States dollars.

Item 4.   Purpose of Transactions.
- ------    -----------------------

          The Shares were acquired for the purpose of making a
profit.  The Reporting Persons expect to monitor the Company's
performance by, among other things, having discussions from time to
time with management, employees and/or directors of the Company,
other shareholders, market and business analysts, and others.
Depending on various factors which they deem relevant, the
Reporting Persons may hold the Shares, buy more shares or sell some
or all of the Shares from time to time.
