     This  statement  amends the  Schedule  13D filed by the  Public  Employees'
Retirement  Association  of Colorado  ("PERA") with the  Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "Commission") on March 24, 1997 relating to the common shares of
beneficial interests,  par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Shares"), of Grove
Real Estate Asset Trust (the "Issuer").

Item 5. Interest in Securities of the Issuer

     Item 5 is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:

     (a) As of April 1, 1997, PERA beneficially owns no shares of Common Stock.

     (b) PERA has the sole power to vote or direct the vote,  and the sole power
to dispose or direct the disposition,  of no Common Shares.  PERA has the shared
power to vote or direct the vote,  and the shared power to dispose or direct the
disposition, of no Common Shares.

     (c) As of March  31,  1997,  PERA  entered  into an  Amended  and  Restated
Agreement  of Limited  Partnership  of the Morgan  Stanley  Real Estate  Special
Situations Fund II, L.P. (the "Partnership") among PERA, as Limited Partner, and
MS Real Estate Special  Situations GP Inc., as General Partner (the "Partnership
Agreement").  On April 1,  1997,  PERA  transferred  all of its  282,829  Common
Shares, valued at $ 2,545,461, to the Partnership as a capital contribution.

     (d) Not applicable.

     (e) PERA ceased to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of the
Common Shares of the Issuer on April 1, 1997.


Item 6. Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships with Respect to
        Securities of the Issuer.

     Item 6 is hereby amended by adding the following supplemental information:

     On April 1, 1997, PERA  transferred all of its 282,829 Common Shares to the
Partnership as a capital  contribution.  Pursuant to the Partnership  Agreement,
PERA has no part in the  management  and  control of the  Partnership,  which is
vested exclusively in the General Partner.

     The Partnership  Agreement provides that the assets of the Partnership,  to
the extent  not  required  for the  payment of  Partnership  expenses,  shall be
invested in a managed account (the "Managed  Account") pursuant to an investment
management  agreement  (the  "Management  Agreement")  entered  into between the
Partnership and Morgan Stanley Asset  Management  Inc.  ("MSAM") as of March 31,
1997.  PERA may  require  that the  General  Partner  terminate  the  Management
Agreement, sell all or any part of the assets invested in the Managed Account to
satisfy  those  claims  with  respect  to which the  Partnership  has  agreed to
indemnify  MSAM  pursuant to the  Management  Agreement  or take or refrain from
taking any other action with respect to the Management Agreement.  PERA may also
elect to dissolve  the  Partnership  or remove the General  Partner upon 30 days
notice in accordance with the Partnership Agreement.

     SECTION  7.01.  Reports.  (a) The  books  of  account  and  records  of the
Partnership  shall be audited  (i) as of the end of each Fiscal Year and (ii) at
such other times as the Limited  Partner  shall  request,  by the  Partnership's
independent  public  accountants.  All reports  provided to the Limited  Partner
pursuant  to this  Section  7.01  shall be  prepared  on the same  basis as that
followed by the  Partnership  for purposes of filing the  Partnership's  federal
income tax returns.

     The Partnership's independent public accountants shall initially be Ernst &
Young, LLP. The Partnership's independent public accountants shall thereafter be
a nationally recognized independent certified public accounting firm selected by
the General Partner.

     (b)  Within  90 days  after the end of each  fiscal  quarter,  the  General
Partner  shall  prepare  and mail to the  Limited  Partner an  unaudited  report
setting forth as of the end of such fiscal quarter:

         (1) unless such quarter is the last fiscal quarter,  a balance sheet of
the Partnership;

         (2) unless such quarter is the last fiscal quarter, an income statement
of the Partnership for such fiscal quarter; and

         (3) a status report of the Partnership's  activities during such fiscal
quarter.

     (c) Within 90 days after the end of each Fiscal Year,  the General  Partner
shall  prepare (or cause to be  prepared)  and mail to the Limited  Partner,  an
audited report setting forth as of the end of such Fiscal Year:

         (1) a balance sheet of the Partnership;

         (2) an income statement of the Partnership for such Fiscal Year; and

         (3) a statement of each Partner's Capital Account.

     (d) After the end of each Fiscal Year, the General  Partner shall cause the
independent certified public accountants to prepare and transmit, as promptly as
possible,  and in any event  within 90 days of the close of the Fiscal  Year,  a
federal income tax form K-1 for each Partner, a copy of the Partnership's return
filed for federal  income tax purposes and a report  setting forth in sufficient
detail such transactions  effected by the Partnership during such Fiscal Year as

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                         EXCULPATION AND INDEMNIFICATION

     SECTION 8.01.  Exculpation  and  Indemnification.  (a) The General  Partner
shall not be liable to the Partnership or to the Limited Partner for any losses,
claims,  damages or  liabilities  arising from any act or omission  performed or
omitted  by it  arising  out of or in  connection  with  this  Agreement  or the
Partnership's  business or affairs,  except for any such loss, claim,  damage or
liability  primarily  attributable to the General  Partner's breach of fiduciary
duty, negligence or willful misconduct.

     (b) The Partnership  shall,  to the fullest extent  permitted by applicable
law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the General Partner against any losses,
claims,  damages or liabilities to which the General  Partner may become subject
in  connection  with  any  matter  arising  out of or in  connection  with  this
Agreement or the  Partnership's  business or affairs,  except for any such loss,
claim,  damage or liability (i) primarily  attributable to the General Partner's
breach of fiduciary  duty,  negligence or willful  misconduct or (ii)  resulting
from a claim made by the Limited  Partner for which the General Partner is found
liable.  If the General Partner becomes  involved in any capacity in any action,
proceeding or  investigation  in connection with any matter arising out of or in
connection  with this Agreement or the  Partnership's  business or affairs,  the
Partnership shall, subject to Section 3.05(a)(4),  reimburse the General Partner
for its legal and other expenses  (including the cost of any  investigation  and
preparation)  as they are incurred in  connection  therewith,  provided that the
General  Partner shall promptly repay to the  Partnership the amount of any such
reimbursed  expenses paid to it if it shall  ultimately  be determined  that the
General  Partner  was not  entitled  to be  indemnified  by the  Partnership  in
connection  with such action,  proceeding  or  investigation.  If for any reason
(other than the breach of fiduciary  duty,  negligence or willful  misconduct of
the General Partner) the foregoing indemnification is unavailable to the General
Partner,  or  insufficient  to hold it  harmless,  then  the  Partnership  shall
contribute  to the amount paid or payable by the General  Partner as a result of
such  loss,  claim,  damage,  liability  or  expense  in such  proportion  as is
appropriate to reflect the relative  benefits received by the Partnership on the
one hand and the General Partner on the other hand or, if such allocation is not
permitted by applicable law, to reflect not only the relative  benefits referred
to above but also any other relevant equitable considerations.

     (c) Each Partner (the "Reimbursing  Partner")  covenants for itself and its
successors,  assigns, heirs and personal  representatives that such Person will,
at any time prior to or after  dissolution of the Partnership on demand,  pay to
the  Partnership or the General  Partner any amount which the Partnership or the
General  Partner,  as the  case may be,  pays in  respect  of  taxes  (including
withholding  taxes) imposed upon income of or  distributions  to the Reimbursing
Partner;  provided  that a Partner  shall not be obligated to pay any amounts in
respect of taxes which arise  under this  paragraph  solely as the result of the
breach of  fiduciary  duty,  negligence  or willful  misconduct  of the  General
Partner.

     (d) Subject to Section  3.05(e),  the obligations of the Partnership  under
Section  8.01(b) or any Partner under Section 8.01(c) shall inure to the benefit
of the controlling  persons of the General Partner and the directors,  officers,
employees and agents of the General Partner and its controlling  persons and any
successors, assigns, heirs and personal representatives of such Persons.


                                   ARTICLE IX

                   DURATION AND DISSOLUTION OF THE PARTNERSHIP

     SECTION  9.01.  Duration.   Subject  to  Section  9.02,  the  term  of  the
Partnership  shall  continue  until  March 31,  2003 (the  "Termination  Date");
provided that with the agreement of the General  Partner and the Limited Partner
the term of the Partnership may be extended to such later date as agreed upon by
the General Partner and the Limited Partner subject to Section 9.02.

     SECTION  9.02  Dissolution.  Subject to the Delaware Act and Article X, the
Partnership  shall  be  dissolved  and its  affairs  shall  be wound up upon the
earliest to occur of:

     (a) the expiration of the term of the Partnership provided in Section 9.01;

     (b) the election of the Limited Partner to dissolve the Partnership;

     (c) a decision  made by the General  Partner  after  receiving  the written
consent  of the  Limited  Partner,  with  such  consent  not to be  unreasonably
withheld, to dissolve the Partnership because the General Partner has determined
that changes in any applicable law or regulation  would have a material  adverse
effect on the continuation of the Partnership;

     (d) an event of  withdrawal of the General  Partner  (within the meaning of
the  Delaware  Act)  unless  within 90 days after the event of  withdrawal,  the
Limited  Partner  determines  to continue  the business of the  Partnership  and
agrees in writing to the  appointment,  effective as of the date of the event of
withdrawal, of a new general partner; and

     (e)  conviction  of the Limited  Partner in, or  subjection  of the Limited
Partner to,  criminal  proceedings or  investigations,  or the subjection of the
Limited Partner to judgments, decrees or final orders in a civil proceeding of a
judicial or administrative body which, in the reasonable judgment of the General
Partner,  make it  impractical  for the General  Partner to continue  its duties
under this Agreement.

     SECTION  9.03.   Winding  Up  of   Partnership.   Upon   dissolution,   the
Partnership's  business  shall be wound up in an  orderly  manner.  The  General
Partner  shall  be the  liquidator  to wind up the  affairs  of the  Partnership
pursuant to this Agreement.  If no general partner remains,  the Limited Partner
may approve one or more liquidators to act as the liquidator in



                                       13
<PAGE>




carrying out such liquidation.

     SECTION 9.04. Distribution Upon Dissolution of the Partnership. (a) Subject
to the Delaware Act,  after all  liabilities,  contingent  or otherwise,  of the
Partnership  (including any liabilities to Partners) have been satisfied or duly
provided for (as reasonably determined by the liquidator in its discretion), the
remaining  assets of the  Partnership  shall be  distributed  to the Partners in
proportion  to  their  positive   Capital   Accounts  (after  giving  effect  to
adjustments  attributable  to all  Partnership  transactions  prior  to any such
distribution) up to the amount thereof  provided,  that the liquidator shall, if
requested by any  Partner,  use its  reasonable  best efforts to sell all or any
portion of such assets to which such Partner is entitled and  distribute the net
proceeds thereof to such Partner; and

     (b) No Partner  shall have priority over any other Partner as to the return
of its Capital Contributions.

                                    ARTICLE X

                  TRANSFERABILITY OF GENERAL PARTNER'S INTEREST

     SECTION 10.01. Transferability of General Partner's Interest. (a) Except as
otherwise  provided  herein,  the General  Partner may not  Transfer  all or any
portion of its  interest in the  Partnership  without the prior  approval of the
Limited Partner.

     (b)  Notwithstanding  anything else contained  herein,  the General Partner
may,  at any time or from  time to time  without  the  approval  of the  Limited
Partner,  Transfer  all  or  any  portion  of its  interest  in the  Partnership
(including  some or all of its rights or  obligations  hereunder) to one or more
Affiliates  of  Morgan  Stanley  (provided  that  there  shall at all times be a
general  partner  having a net worth  (determined  in accordance  with generally
accepted  accounting  principles)  at least  equivalent  to that of the  General
Partner).

     (c) Any Person to whom the General Partner  Transfers all or any portion of
its  Interest  shall be admitted to the  Partnership  as a general  partner upon
execution of a counterpart  hereof.  If the General Partner transfers all of its
Interests and the transferee is entitled to become a substitute  general partner
in accordance with this Section  10.01(c),  such transferee shall be admitted to
the Partnership as a general  partner  immediately  prior to the Transfer,  and,
immediately  following such admission,  the  transferring  General Partner shall
cease to be a General Partner.  Notwithstanding  Section 9.02(d), the substitute
general  partner  shall  continue  the  business  of  the  Partnership   without
dissolution.

     SECTION 10.02.  Removal of the General Partner;  Resignation by the General
Partner. (a) Upon 30 calendar days' prior notice, the Limited Partner shall have
the right to remove  the  General  Partner  at any time for any  reason.  If the
Limited Partner elects to exercise its right pursuant to this Section  10.02(a),
the Limited Partner shall deliver a notice to such effect to the General Partner
and specify the date upon which such removal shall become effective. In the



                                       14
<PAGE>




event that the Limited  Partner  designates a substitute  general partner in the
notice  removing the General  Partner such  substitute  general partner shall be
admitted  as a  general  partner  of the  Partnership  immediately  prior to the
removal of the General Partner,  and (i)  notwithstanding  Section 9.02(d),  the
substitute  general  partner  shall  continue  the  business of the  Partnership
without dissolution,  and (ii) the General Partner shall do all things necessary
to  effectively  transfer  the  management  and  to  convey  all  assets  of the
Partnership  to  such  substitute  general  partner  for  and on  behalf  of the
Partnership on the date of its removal.

     (b) The General  Partner  shall have the right to resign and withdraw  from
the  Partnership  at any time with the  consent of the Limited  Partner.  If the
General  Partner  desires  to  exercise  its  rights  pursuant  to this  Section
10.02(b),  the  General  Partner  shall  deliver a notice to such  effect to the
Limited  Partner  and shall  specify  the date upon which such  resignation  and
withdrawal shall become effective, subject to the consent of the Limited Partner
(which date, in any event, shall not be less than 90 days after the date of such
notice).  Should the Limited Partner  provide such consent,  the Limited Partner
may  designate a  substitute  general  partner to continue  the  business of the
Partnership without dissolution in accordance with the third sentence of Section
10.02(a).


                                   ARTICLE XI

                  TRANSFERABILITY OF LIMITED PARTNER'S INTEREST

     SECTION  11.01.  No Transfer  of Limited  Partner's  Interest.  The Limited
Partner shall not be permitted (i) to withdraw from the Partnership prior to the
dissolution  and winding up of the  Partnership  or (ii) to Transfer its limited
partner   interest  in  whole  or  in  part  to  any  Person;   provided   that,
notwithstanding  anything  else  contained  in this Article or elsewhere in this
Agreement, the Limited Partner may Transfer its limited partner interest without
approval by the General  Partner to any successor  authorized or directed by the
Colorado State Legislature to perform the Limited Partner's  investment  duties,
in  whole  or in  part,  with  respect  to such  state's  retirement  funds,  or
authorized  or  directed by the state's  governor by  executive  order if issued
under the governor's scope of authority to do so. Such transferee of all or part
of the  Limited  Partner's  limited  partner  interest  shall be admitted to the
Partnership as a limited partner upon execution of a counterpart  hereof. If the
Limited Partner Transfers all of its limited partner interest in accordance with
this  Section  11.01  and the  transferee  is  entitled  to be  admitted  to the
Partnership as a limited  partner in accordance  with this Section  11.01,  such
transferee shall be admitted to the Partnership as a limited partner immediately
prior  to  the  Transfer,   and,  immediately  following  such  admission,   the
transferring  Limited  Partner  shall  cease  to be a  limited  partner  of  the
Partnership.  The Limited  Partner shall provide at least 10 days written notice
to the General Partner of its intention to make such a Transfer.

                                   ARTICLE XII

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

     SECTION  12.01.  Amendment  to the  Agreement.  (a) This  Agreement  may be
amended  only with the written  approval of the General  Partner and the Limited
Partner.

     SECTION 12.02. Investment  Representation.  Each Partner, by executing this
Agreement, represents and warrants that its Interest has been acquired by it for
its own account,  or for the account of a commingled  pension trust with respect
to whom it has full investment discretion, for investment and not with a view to
resale or  distribution  thereof  and that it is fully  aware  that the  General
Partner and the Partnership,  in agreeing to admit it as a Partner,  are relying
upon the truth and accuracy of this representation and warranty.

     SECTION  12.03.  Successors;  Counterparts.  This  Agreement  (i)  shall be
binding as to the executors, administrators, estates, heirs and legal successors

counterpart.

     SECTION  12.04.  Governing  Law;  Severability.  This  Agreement  shall  be

particular,  it shall be construed to the maximum extent possible to comply with
all of the terms and conditions of the Delaware Act. If, nevertheless,  it shall
be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that any provision or wording
of this  Agreement  shall be  invalid or  unenforceable  under said Act or other
applicable  law, such  invalidity or  unenforceability  shall not invalidate the
entire Agreement. In that case, this Agreement shall be construed so as to limit
any  term  or  provision  so as to make  it  enforceable  or  valid  within  the
requirements of applicable law, and, in the event such term or provision  cannot
be so  limited,  this  Agreement  shall be  construed  to omit such  invalid  or
unenforceable provisions.

     SECTION  12.05.  Filings.  Following  the  execution  and  delivery of this
Agreement,  the General Partner shall promptly prepare any documents required to
be filed and recorded  under the Delaware  Act,  and the General  Partner  shall
promptly  cause each such document to be filed and recorded in  accordance  with
said Act and, to the extent  required by local law, to be filed and  recorded or
notice thereof to be published in the  appropriate  place in each state in which
the Partnership may hereafter establish a place of business. The General Partner
shall also promptly cause to be filed, recorded and published such statements of
fictitious  business name and other notices,  certificates,  statements or other
instruments required by any provision of any applicable law of the United States
or any state or other  jurisdiction  which  governs the conduct of its  business
from time to time.

     SECTION  12.06.  Power  of  Attorney.   The  Limited  Partner  does  hereby
constitute and appoint the General Partner as its true and lawful representative
and attorney-in-fact, in its



                                       16
<PAGE>




name, place and stead to make, execute, sign, deliver and file (a) a Certificate
of Limited  Partnership  of the  Partnership,  any  amendment  thereof  required
because of an amendment to this  Agreement or in order to effectuate  any change
in the  membership of the  Partnership,  (b) any  amendments  to this  Agreement
pursuant  to Section  12.01 and (c) all such other  instruments,  documents  and
certificates  which may from time to time be  required by the laws of the United
States of America,  the State of Delaware or any other state,  or any  political
subdivision or agency thereof, or any foreign country, to effectuate,  implement
and  continue  the valid  and  subsisting  existence  of the  Partnership  or to
dissolve the Partnership in accordance with this Agreement.

     The power of attorney  granted hereby is coupled with an interest and shall
(i) survive and not be affected by the subsequent death, incapacity, disability,
dissolution, termination or bankruptcy of the Limited Partner and (ii) extend to
such Limited Partner's successors, assigns and legal representatives.

     SECTION  12.07.  Headings.  Section and other  headings  contained  in this
Agreement  are for  reference  purposes  only and are not  intended to describe,
interpret,  define  or  limit  the  scope or  intent  of this  Agreement  or any
provision hereof.

     SECTION 12.08. Further Assurances. The Limited Partner, upon the request of
the General Partner, agrees to perform all further acts and execute, acknowledge
and deliver any  documents  that may be  reasonably  necessary  to carry out the
provisions of this Agreement.

     SECTION 12.09.  Goodwill.  No value shall be placed on the name or goodwill
of the Partnership.

     SECTION  12.10.  Notices.  All  notices  and other  written  communications
