          Re:  Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock
               -----------------------------------------------

Dear Sirs:

          This letter will confirm our understanding with respect to the Series
B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Series B Preferred Stock") of
USF&G Corporation (the "Company") currently held by you (the "GE Entities").

          1.   In the event that USF&G gives notice of redemption of the Series
B Preferred Stock 1995 and Series B Preferred Stock 1996 (each as defined in the
Articles Supplementary pursuant to which the Series B Cumulative Convertible
Preferred Stock of the Company was issued, referred to hereafter as the
"Articles Supplementary"), the GE Entities hereby agree to convert into Common
Stock of the Company (the "Conversion Shares") all of the Series B Preferred
Stock 1995 and Series B Preferred Stock 1996 currently held by the GE Entities
(the "GE Preferred Stock 1995 and 1996"), which conversion shall be in
accordance with the terms of the Articles Supplementary and the Notice of
Partial Redemption issued in connection with such call for redemption (the
"Notice").  The GE Preferred Stock 1995 and 1996 will be converted into the
Conversion Shares on or before the day immediately preceding the redemption due
date as set forth in the Notice (the "Final Conversion Date"); provided,
                                                               --------
however, that in the event the GE Entities are prohibited from exercising the
- -------
right to convert any or all of the GE Preferred 


                               Page 44 of 71 Pages



<PAGE>






Stock 1995 and 1996 under the Articles Supplementary because the applicable
waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1972, as
amended (the "Legal Impediment") has not expired or been subject to an early
termination, then the conversion with respect to any such shares of GE Preferred
Stock 1995 and 1996 which are subject to the Legal Impediment shall not be
consummated and made effective until the earlier of:  (i) the date that the
Legal Impediment is removed; or (ii) thirty (30) days following the Final
Conversion Date (in either case, the "Release Date").  In such event, other than
the right to convert the GE Preferred Stock 1995 and 1996 into Conversion Shares
as set forth herein, the GE Entities shall have no further rights with respect
to the GE Preferred Stock 1995 and 1996 subject to the Legal Impediment,
including, without limitation, any right to receive dividends with respect
thereto from and  after the Final Conversion Date, and the GE Entities shall
have no voting or other rights with respect to such Conversion Shares subject to
Legal Impediment until the Release Date.  On the Release Date, the GE Entities
shall receive the Conversion Shares previously subject to the Legal Impediment,
together with cash in lieu of fractional shares and payment for any accrued but
unpaid dividends to the Final Conversion Date (in each case, without interest),
all as if the GE Preferred Stock 1995 and 1996 had been converted in accordance
with their terms and the Notice on the Final Conversion Date. 

          2.   In consideration of the commitment by the GE Entities to convert
the GE Preferred Stock 1995 and 1996 as  described herein and the resulting
savings realized by USF&G by eliminating the need to engage underwritten call
facilities, the Company will, as soon as practicable after the date of the
Notice, deliver by wire transfer to an account designated by General Electric
Investment Corporation, the  amount of $50,000 for the benefit of the GE
Entities. 

          3.   The Company will file a new registration statement on Form S-3 to
include up to two million five hundred thousand of the Conversion Shares for
sale by selling shareholders to be designated by General Electric Investment
Corporation and will include such information in such registration statement as
the GE Entities may reasonably request so as to permit sales of the Conversion
Shares by the designated GE Entities in accordance with all applicable law.  
The GE Entities and USF&G each agree to cooperate with one another to promptly
file such registration statement as soon as practicable following the date of
the Notice.  USF&G shall pay any required registration fees to the Securities
and Exchange Commission required in connection therewith, and the fees and
expenses of its own counsel and  auditors.  The GE Entities and General Electric
Investment Corporation will pay their own fees and the fees and expenses of
their own counsel.  USF&G will not treat the filing of such registration
statement as a demand 


                               Page 45 of 71 Pages

registration under paragraph 7D of the Stock Purchase Agreement dated June 3,
1991 among the Company, the GE Entities and certain other parties (the "Stock
Purchase Agreement"), but such registration statement will be subject to and
governed by the provisions of paragraph 7G (except that an opinion of in-house
counsel shall be deemed satisfactory for purposes of paragraph 7G (vi)) and 7J
thereof, as applicable. 

          4.   Except as specifically provided hereunder, nothing in this letter
agreement shall affect the respective rights and duties of the parties hereto
under the Stock Purchase Agreement. 

          5.   Acceptance of this letter agreement by the GE Entities will
constitute the several representation and warranty of each of them that each has
full power and authority to enter into this letter agreement and that each owns,
free and clear of any security interests or other liens, the cumulative number
of shares of Series B Preferred Stock 1995 and Series B Preferred Stock 1996 set
forth beneath its signature, which equal 750,000 in the aggregate.
 
          This proposal has been duly authorized and executed by the Company. 
If you are in agreement with the terms hereof, please signify your agreement by
executing this letter agreement in the space provided below and returning an
executed copy hereof to the Company by facsimile at (410) 234-2056, at which
time this letter agreement will constitute a valid and binding agreement among
the parties hereto. 

                         Very truly yours,

                         USF&G CORPORATION

          Re:  Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock
               -----------------------------------------------

Dear Sirs:

          This letter will clarify and amend our understanding with you (the "GE
Entities") regarding the Series B Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock) (the
"Series B Preferred Stock") of USF&G Corporation (the "Company") which was
originally expressed in a letter among us dated October 11, 1995 (the "Original
Letter").

          The delivery by the Company of $50,000 to General Electric Investment
Corporation for the benefit of the GE Entities, as originally described in
paragraph 2 of the Original Letter as consideration for the conversion of the
Series B Preferred Stock by the GE Entities, is rather to reimburse the GE
Entities for their counsel fees and out-of-pocket expenses incurred in

          Item 1.  Security and Issuer.
                   -------------------

          The security to which this statement relates is the common stock, par
value $2.50 per share (the "Common Stock"), of USF&G Corporation, a Maryland
corporation (the "Company"), whose principal executive offices are located at
100 Light Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21202.  Although no person identified in
Item 2 (except as otherwise indicated in this statement) has acquired any shares
of Common Stock, such persons are deemed to be the beneficial owners of the
shares of Common Stock reported in Item 5 by virtue of their acquisition of
beneficial ownership of shares of the Company's Series B Cumulative Convertible
Preferred Stock (the "Series B Stock").

          The reporting persons may constitute a group as such term is used in
Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act").  Information with respect to each Reporting Person is given
solely by such Reporting Person and no Reporting Person has responsibility for
the accuracy or completeness of information supplied by any other Reporting
Person.  The Reporting Persons have entered into a Joint Filing Agreement, dated
February 13, 1992, attached hereto as Schedule I.

          Item 2.  Identity and Background.
                   -----------------------

          This statement is filed on behalf of Trustees of General Electric
Pension Trust, a New York common law trust ("GEPT"), GE Investment Private
Placement Partners I, a Delaware limited partnership (the "Partnership"),
General Electric Mortgage Insurance Corporation, a North Carolina corporation
("GEMIC"), Employers Reinsurance Corporation, a Missouri corporation ("ERC");
and Elfun Trusts, a Connecticut trust ("Elfun"), and S&S Program Mutual Fund, a
New York common law trust ("S&S") each a Reporting Person.

          The address of the principal offices of GEPT, the Partnership, GEMIC,
ERC, Elfun and S&S is 3003 Summer Street, Stamford, Connecticut 06904.

          For information with respect to the identity and background of each
(i) Trustee of GEPT see Schedule II attached hereto; (ii) partner of the
Partnership see Schedule III attached hereto; (iii) executive officer and
director of GEMIC see Schedule IV attached hereto; (iv) executive officer and
director of ERC see Schedule V attached hereto; and (v) Trustee of Elfun see

          During the last five years, neither any Reporting Person nor, to the
best knowledge of each Reporting Person, any person identified in Schedules II
through VII has (i) been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic
violations or similar misdemeanors) or (ii) except as set forth in Schedule VIII
attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference, been a party to a civil
proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as
a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final
order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities
subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with
respect to such laws.

          All Reporting Persons and, to the best knowledge of each Reporting
Person, all persons identified in Schedules II through VII are United States
citizens.

          Item 3.   Source and Amount of Funds and Other Consideration.
                    --------------------------------------------------

          On June 3, 1991, the Company, the Reporting Persons and certain other
parties entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Stock Purchase Agreement")
providing for the purchase by (i) GEPT of 420,000 shares of Series B Stock at an
aggregate purchase price of $41,370,000; (ii) the Partnership of 300,000 shares
of Series B Stock at an aggregate purchase price of $29,550,000; (iii) GEMIC of
150,000 shares of Series B Stock at an aggregate purchase price of $14,775,000;
(iv) ERC of 100,000 shares of Series B Stock at an aggregate purchase price of
$9,850,000; and (v) Elfun of 30,000 shares of Series B Stock at an aggregate
purchase price of $2,955,000.  A copy of the Stock Purchase Agreement is
attached hereto as Exhibit 1.  The funds used by the Reporting Persons to pay
for their shares of Series B Stock were obtained by (i) GEPT from trust assets;
(ii) the Partnership from capital contributions made by its partners pursuant to
a pre-existing capital commitment; (iii) GEMIC from its working capital; (iv)
ERC from its working capital; and (v) Elfun from trust assets.

          In addition to the shares of Series B Stock listed above, on June 3,
1991, GEPT beneficially owned 124,681 shares of Common Stock which it had
previously purchased with funds from trust assets and S&S beneficially owned 
21,400 shares of Common Stock which it had previously purchased with funds from
trust assets.

          Item 4.  Purpose of Transaction.
                   ----------------------

          The Reporting Persons have acquired the Series B Stock from the
Company as an investment.  While the 


                               Page 58 of 71 Pages




<PAGE>






Reporting Persons have no present intention of seeking control, they will
continue to review their investment in the Company and monitor and evaluate
future development at the Company and, based upon such analysis, may (i) attempt
to acquire additional shares of Common Stock (subject to availability of shares
at prices deemed favorable), (ii) convert their Series B Stock in whole or in
part, or (iii) dispose of shares of Common Stock received upon conversion of
Series B Stock in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or
otherwise. 

          The powers, rights and privileges of the Series B Stock are described
in the Company's Articles Supplementary, Series B Cumulative Convertible
Preferred Stock and 11% Preferred Stock of USF&G Corporation (the "Articles
Supplementary"), a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.  Each share of
Series B Stock is convertible into Common Stock at the option of the holder, at
any time, into a number of shares of common stock determined by dividing the
liquidation value of the Series B Stock of $100 by the applicable conversion
price as more fully described in the Articles Supplementary.  The initial
conversion price is $12.025 (the "Initial Conversion Price").  Accrued dividends
shall be paid in cash upon conversion of the Series B Stock and quarterly Common
Stock dividends shall be prorated accordingly.

          In addition, if prior to June 1, 1992 the Company (i) shall have
issued or sold any convertible security or instrument convertible into common
stock at less than the Initial Conversion Price or (ii) shall have issued or
sold any Common Stock at a price per share less than the average of the closing
price for Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange for each of the 20
consecutive days immediately preceding the date of issue of the Series B Stock
(the "Average Price") or (iii) shall have issued or sold warrants, options or
rights to purchase Common Stock at a price such that the sum of such price and
the price at which such instrument may be exercised is less than the Initial
Conversion Price, then the Initial Conversion Price shall be adjusted to (xx) in
the case of (i) above, the price at which such convertible security or
instrument may be exercised or (yy) in the case of (ii) above, the sale price of
such Common Stock plus 15% of such sale price or (zz) in the case of (iii)
above, the sum of the price of such instrument and its exercise price, provided,
however, there shall be no adjustment for issuances to officers or key employees
of the Company or for issuances that yield gross proceeds in excess of
$15,000,000 in the aggregate.  In no event may the Initial Conversion Price be
less than $10.00.

          If the Initial Conversion Price would have been reduced to less than
$10.00 but for the above prohibition 


                               Page 59 of 71 Pages




<PAGE>






(the Initial Conversion Price as so adjusted without regard to any prohibition
on a price below $10.00, being referred to as the "Fully Adjusted Conversion
Price"), the Company has agreed, without additional consideration therefor, to
issue a number of whole or fractional shares of its 11% Preferred Stock to each
holder of Series B Stock calculated pursuant to the following formula:  Fully
Adjusted Conversion Price multiplied by Incremental Shares multiplied by 0.5,
divided by $10,000.  For the purposes of this formula "Incremental Shares" means
(A) that number of shares of Common Stock that each holder of Series B Stock
would have received upon conversion of such Series B Stock if the Initial
Conversion Price had been the Fully Adjusted Conversion Price, less (B) that
number of shares of Common Stock each holder will receive upon conversion
assuming an Initial Conversion Price of $10.00.  The 11% Preferred Stock, if
issued, would have a liquidation preference of $10,000 per share, an annual
dividend rate of $1,100 per share, be mandatorily redeemed in full in ten years
from the date of issue, be optionally redeemable three years from the date of
issue at a redemption premium, would not be convertible into Common Stock and
would rank pari passu with the Series B Stock.
           ---- -----

          The Series B Stock is redeemable at the option of the Company for
cash, as a whole or in part, on and after the third anniversary of the date of
issue thereof, at a per share redemption price equal to the liquidation value of
$100.00 and accrued and unpaid dividends plus a premium based on the dividend
rate of the Series B Stock declining ratably to zero over ten years. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no redemption may be effected prior to the sixth
anniversary of the date of issue unless the closing price of the Common Stock
exceeds 150% of the then current Series B Conversion Price for each of the
twenty prior consecutive trading days, and, further, not more than one-half of
the Series B Stock may be redeemed prior to the fourth anniversary, and not more
than three-quarters prior to the fifth anniversary, of the issue date.  On and
after the sixth anniversary of the issue date, all of the Series B Stock may be
redeemed at a redemption price which includes the redemption premium stated
above.

          In addition, in the event that there shall occur a "change in control"
(as defined below) of the Company, then, at the election of each holder of
Series B Stock, the Company will issue and sell additional nonredeemable equity
securities and apply the net proceeds thereof to redeem the Series B Stock at
the appropriate redemption price, plus accrued dividends, but only if and to the
extent any such proceeds are raised.  The term "change in control" means any
acquisition by any person or group of 50% or more of the combined voting power
of the outstanding voting securities 


                               Page 60 of 71 Pages

of the Company, a sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company, or a
merger of the Company with or into another person which results in the exchange,
conversion, reclassification or cancellation of the Common Stock of the Company.

          In case of the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Company, holders of shares of Series B Stock are entitled to
receive $100.00 per share, plus dividends accrued and unpaid to the payment
date, before any distribution is made to the holders of any junior stock.

          The Company has agreed to nominate and recommend as a candidate for
election to the Board of Directors of the Company a Person who is reasonably
acceptable to the then current Board of Directors of the Company and who is
designated by the general partner of the Partnership, so long as the Partnership
shall be the beneficial owner of any Series B Stock or any Common Stock issued
upon conversion of the Series B Stock.  If at any time the Partnership is no
longer the beneficial owner of any Series B Stock or Common Stock issued upon
conversion thereof, the Company will, upon the expiration of the term of the
Director designated by the Partnership, so nominate and recommend a Person who
is reasonably acceptable to the then current Board of Directors who is
designated by the holders representing 50% or more of the Series B Stock held by
holders of $1,000,000 or more in aggregate liquidation value of Series B Stock.

          Except as set forth above, neither any Reporting Person nor, to the
best knowledge of each Reporting Person, any person identified in Schedules II-
VII, has any present plans or proposals which relate to or would result in:  (a)
the acquisition by any person of additional securities of the Company, or the
disposition of securities of the Company; (b) an extraordinary corporate
transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving the
Company or any of its subsidiaries; (c) a sale or transfer of a material amount
of assets of the Company or of any of its subsidiaries; (d) any change in the
present board of directors or management of the Company, including any plans or
proposals to change the number or term of directors or to fill any existing
vacancies on the board; (e) any material change in the present capitalization or
dividend policy of the Company; (f) any other material change in the Company's
business or corporate structure; (g) changes in the Company's charter, by-laws
or instruments corresponding thereto or other actions which may impede the
acquisition of control of the Company by any person; (h) causing a class of
securities of the Company to be delisted from a national securities exchange or
to cease to be authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a
registered

national securities association; (i) a class of equity securities of the Company
becoming eligible for termination of registration pursuant to Section 12(g)(4)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; or (j) any action similar to any of
those enumerated above.

          Item 5.   Interest in Securities of the Issuer. 
                    ------------------------------------

          (a)  (i) GEPT has beneficial ownership of 3,617,401 shares of Common
Stock, representing 4.128% of such class currently outstanding; (ii) the
Partnership has beneficial ownership of 2,494,800 shares of Common Stock,
representing 2.879 % of such class currently outstanding; (iii) GEMIC has
beneficial ownership of 1,247,400 shares of Common Stock, representing 1.461 %
of such class currently outstanding; (iv) EIC has beneficial ownership of
831,600 shares of Common Stock, representing .979% of such class currently
outstanding; and (v) Elfun has beneficial ownership of 249,480 shares of Common
Stock, representing .296% of such class currently outstanding; and (vi) S&S has
beneficial ownership of 21,400 shares of Common Stock, representing .025% of
such class currently outstanding.  If the Reporting Persons are deemed to be a
group for the purposes of Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, (i) 146,081 shares of Common Stock are currently benefically owned by such
group and (ii) under the circumstances described in Item 4 and 6 and in the
Articles Supplementary, the 1,000,000 shares of Series B Stock beneficially
owned by such group is convertible into 8,316,000 shares of Common Stock.  After
giving effect to the issuance of such shares of Common Stock upon conversion of
the Series B Stock, if the Reporting Persons are deemed to be a group, they will
beneficially own 8,462,081 shares of Common Stock or approximately 9.152% of the
issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock based on the 84,147,920 shares of
Common Stock, which the Stock Purchase Agreement states were outstanding as of
May 23, 1991.

          (b)  Each Reporting Person has the sole power to vote or direct the
voting of the Series B Stock of which it is beneficial owner and, subject to the
provisions of the Stock Purchase Agreement (described in Items 4 and 6), each
Reporting Person has the sole power to dispose or direct the disposition of such
Series B Stock.

          To the best knowledge of the Reporting Persons, no person other than
the Reporting Persons has the power to vote or to direct the vote or to dispose
or direct the disposition of any of the securities which they may be deemed to
beneficially own.

          (c)  Except as set forth above, no Reporting Person nor, to the best
knowledge of each Reporting Person, 


                               Page 62 of 71 Pages




<PAGE>






any person identified in Schedules II through VI, beneficially owns any shares
of Common Stock or has effected any transaction in shares of Common Stock during
the preceding 60 days.

          (d)  No person except for the Reporting Persons are known to have the
right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the
proceeds from the sale of, securities beneficially owned by such Reporting
Person and covered by this statement.

          (e)  Not applicable.


          Item 6.   Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships
                    --------------------------------------------------------
                    with Respect to Securities of the Issuer.
                    ----------------------------------------

          Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement and Articles Supplementary,
the holders of Series B Stock have received additional rights and are subject to
certain restrictions.

          As described in the Articles Supplementary, the affirmative vote of
the holders of at least 66-2/3% of the outstanding shares of Series B Stock is
necessary to (i) authorize, increase the authorized number of shares of, or
issue any shares of any class of the Company's capital stock that would be
senior or superior as to dividends or upon liquidation to the Series B Stock,
(ii) increase the authorized number of shares of, or issue any shares of
Preferred Stock authorized in the Company's Charter or create any other class of
stock (or any other series of Preferred Stock) ranking on a parity with Series B
Stock, 11% Preferred Stock, or any other Parity Stock as to dividends and upon
liquidation, (iii) reissue any shares of Series B Stock that have been redeemed
or (iv) take any action to cause any amendment, alteration or repeal of any of
the provisions of the Company's Charter that would materially adversely affect
the rights of holders of Series B Stock.

          As further described in the Articles Supplementary, if on any date
dividends payable on the Preferred Stock have been in arrears for two
consecutive quarterly periods, the number of directors constituting the Board of
Directors will be increased by two and the holders of shares of Preferred Stock
will have the exclusive right to elect a director of the Company.  Such
additional directors are to continue as directors and such additional voting
right will continue until the earlier of (a) the next annual meeting and the
election (by the holders of shares of Series B Stock and Parity Stock) and
qualification of their

respective successors or (b) the date upon which all dividends in default on the
Preferred Stock have been paid in full.

           Under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement the Company has
agreed that upon the written request of one or more holders of Series B Stock or
Common Stock acquired upon conversion thereof representing not less than 33% of
such shares outstanding (the "Initiating Holders"), the Company will use its
best efforts to register under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, those
shares of Series B Stock or Common Stock acquired upon conversion of Series B
Stock which are requested by the Initiating Holders and (ii) all other Series B
Stock or shares Common Stock acquired upon conversion of Series B Stock which
the Company has been requested to register by any other holder thereof by
written request.  The Company shall not be required to effect more than two such
registrations.

          On June 3, 1991, the Company, the Reporting Persons and certain other
parties also entered into a Standstill Agreement whereby the Reporting Persons
have agreed to certain standstill provisions applicable until the earlier of six
years from the date of issue or the date on which such Reporting Person no
longer owns any Series B Stock or Common Stock into which the Series B Stock has
been converted.  The Standstill Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 3. 
Under these standstill provisions, the Reporting Persons may not make or
participate in any proxy solicitation, initiate, propose or solicit stockholders
of the Company for the approval of any stockholder proposal or induce or attempt
to induce any other person to initiate any stockholder proposal, nor may any
Reporting Person form, join, participate in, or encourage the formation of a
"group" within the meaning of the Exchange Act, nor may any Reporting Person
acquire voting securities or securities convertible into voting securities of
the Company if, after such acquisition, such Reporting Person would beneficially
own in excess of 10% of the fully diluted voting power of the Company's
outstanding voting securities.  In addition, no Reporting Person may deposit any
voting securities into a voting trust, take any action to seek to affect or
influence the control of the management or Board of Directors of the Company or
its business affairs, or directly or indirectly participate, aid or abet any
other person to take any action prohibited by the foregoing.  The limitation on
exercise of control of management or the Board of Directors of the corporation
does not apply to the Partnership which is a "venture capital operating company"
under applicable provisions of the Employees Retirement Income Security Act of
1974.  In addition, that limitation on control will not apply if the Company or
its subsidiaries are in payment default with respect to indebtedness for
borrowed money 


                               Page 64 of 71 Pages

exceeding $25 million for a period of more than 60 days or in the event of
certain bankruptcy events or if the Company has failed to declare and pay
dividends on the Series B Stock with respect to two or more dividend periods and
such dividends remain unpaid.  Each Reporting Person has also agreed not to
transfer or dispose of its shares of Series B Stock or shares of Common Stock
issued upon conversion until the earlier of December 31, 1991, the completion of
the sale of the Company's Series C Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock or the
date of a Significant Change (as defined below).  In addition, until the sixth
anniversary of the issue date, each holder of Series B Stock will use its best
efforts to not sell to any one entity or group securities representing more than
1% of the voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities (other than
routine market sales or sales to underwriters in connection with an underwritten
offering or if a Significant Change, occurs).  "Significant Change" means a very
significant change in the Company's operating plan or a very significant change
in the Company's executive officer ranks representing a replacement of three or
more of the Company's five most senior executive officers in an 18-month period.

          The foregoing descriptions of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the
Articles Supplementary and the Standstill Agreement are qualified in their
entirety by the complete texts of such documents (including exhibits thereto),
copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibits 1, 2 and 3, respectively.

          Except as set forth or incorporated by reference in this Statement,
none of Reporting Parties, nor, to the best of their knowledge, any of their
executive officers and directors, has any contracts, arrangements,
understandings or relationships (legal or otherwise) with any person with
respect to any securities of the Company.
