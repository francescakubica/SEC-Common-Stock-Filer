     ITEM 1.   SECURITY AND ISSUER

               This statement on Schedule 13D (the "Statement") relates to
     shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share (the "Common
     Stock"), of WMX Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
     "Issuer").  The principal executive offices of the Issuer are located
     at 3003 Butterfield Road, Oak Brook, Illinois 60521.

     ITEM 2.  IDENTITY AND BACKGROUND

               This statement is being filed on behalf of (i) Focus
     Investment Management, LLC, a Maine limited liability company
     ("Focus"), and (ii) Ram Trust Services, Inc., a Maine corporation
     ("Ram").  Focus and Ram are engaged primarily in the investment
     management and investment advisory businesses and are owned and
     controlled by their management (as identified below).  Focus and Ram
     conduct certain of their business under the trade name "The Lens
     Group," and Focus, Ram and their management are collectively referred
     to herein as the "Lens Group".  Both Focus and Ram conduct business at
     45 Exchange Street (Suite 400), Portland, Maine 04101 and at 1200 G
     Street, N.W., Suite 800, Washington, D.C. 30005.  

               Each of Focus and Ram manages investment accounts for
     clients, which include members of the management of Focus and Ram and
     affiliated and associated persons as well as unaffiliated persons. 
     Each of Focus and Ram has caused accounts of certain of its clients
     ("Clients"), over which it has discretion, to acquire Common Stock. 
     The Lens Group has voting and disposition power over the Common Stock
     held in these accounts and, accordingly, is deemed the beneficial
     owner for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of
     1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), of the Common Stock held in such
     accounts.  Except for such deemed beneficial ownership, or as
     otherwise described in this Statement, neither Focus nor Ram own any
     Common Stock or other securities of the Issuer.

               Schedules I and II annexed to this Schedule 13D and
     incorporated herein by reference set forth, with respect to Focus, the
     managing member and the other members who participate in Focus's
     management decision-making and, with respect to Ram, its directors,
     executive officers and controlling shareholder: (a) his or her name,
     (b) business address, (c) present principal employment and the name,
     principal business and address of the company in which such employment
     is conducted, (d) whether or not such person has been convicted in a
     criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and similar
     misdemeanors), (e)



                                  Page 4 of 24

     whether or not, during the last five years, such person was a party to
     a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent
     jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a
     judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or
     prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or states
     securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws,
     and (f) citizenship.

     ITEM 3.  SOURCE AND AMOUNT OF FUNDS OR OTHER CONSIDERATION

               Focus and Ram, collectively, have caused their Clients to
     expend $6,165,021 of the Clients' investment funds to purchase a total
     of 192,250 shares of Common Stock as of February 5, 1997.  Subsequent
     to that date and prior to the date hereof, Focus and Ram,
     collectively, have caused their clients to expend $1,565,500 of the
     Clients' investment funds to purchase an additional 50,000 shares of
     Common Stock. 

     ITEM 4.  PURPOSE OF TRANSACTION

               Focus and Ram caused the accounts of the Clients managed by
     them to acquire for investment all of the Common Stock reported herein
     as being owned by their Clients; some of such acquisitions were made
     after the Lens Group determined to participate in the events described
     below which may be considered to affect control of the Issuer.

               The Lens Group has considered and now considers the Issuer
     to have been poorly directed and managed and its Common Stock to be
     undervalued in relation to the assets, business and prospects of the
     Issuer.  Acquisition by Client accounts of Common Stock at the
     direction of Focus and Ram began more than a year ago.  

               From time to time during the past year, the Lens Group has
     discussed with management of the Issuer and other holders of Common
     Stock, including the Soros Group (as defined below), the Lens Group's
     suggestions for enhancing the shareholder value of the Issuer.  Such
     suggestions have concerned possible changes in the Issuer's
     management, directors and business strategy, possible divestitures of
     assets that the Lens Group does not consider necessary to the Issuer's
     core business and the possible acquisition of the minority interests
     in certain of the Issuer's partly-owned subsidiaries, as well as one
     or more of the other possible transactions specified in clauses (a)
     through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D under the 1934 Act.  Specific
     suggestions were presented by the Lens Group to the Issuer in meetings
     held in May, September and December 1996.



                                   Page 5 of 24

               In seeking to enhance the Issuer's shareholder value, the
     Lens Group in recent months has also urged, and has made several
     proposals to the Issuer's management ("Management") and directors
     concerning, the addition of independent directors to the Issuer's
     Board of Directors ("Board").  The Lens Group retained the nationally
     recognized executive and director search firm Spencer Stuart
     Associates ("Spencer Stuart") to identify individuals with outstanding
     qualifications who could be added to the Board.  After extensive
     search efforts, Spencer Stuart advised the Lens Group that it had
     identified appropriate individuals for nomination as directors of the
     Issuer, including Mr. Herbert J. Lanese (whose nomination is discussed
     further below), and the Lens Group commenced meeting with such
     individuals.

               In addition to the foregoing efforts, after several months'
     discussion with Management concerning the matter (including an
     extension by the Issuer of the normal filing deadline for shareholder
     proposals), the Lens Group on January 6, 1997 submitted to the Issuer
     a shareholder proposal pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the 1934 Act for a
     vote at the Issuer's 1997 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  This
     proposal recommends that the Board engage a nationally recognized
     investment banking firm, with no commercial involvement, to explore
     all alternatives to enhance the value of the Issuer and present to the
     shareholders at or prior to the 1998 Annual Meeting of Shareholders a
     plan for maximizing value (the "Strategic Review Proposal").  This
     proposal was submitted jointly with Mr. Kenneth Steiner, a shareholder
     of the Issuer who is not affiliated with the Lens Group, after
     objections were raised by the Issuer that earlier proposals submitted
     by Mr. Steiner and the Lens Group were duplicative.  Except with
     respect to their joint submission of the shareholder proposal, there
     is no agreement or understanding between Mr. Steiner or the Lens Group
     relating to securities of the Issuer and each disclaims any beneficial
     ownership of any securities of the Issuer beneficially owned by the
     other.

               No satisfactory result has yet emerged from the Lens Group's
     discussions with Management, despite Management's repeated statements
     to the Lens Group that it was working hard to address the Issuer's
     problems.  After Management's announcement on February 4, 1997 of a
     restructuring plan for the Issuer, the Lens Group became frustrated
     with Management's lack of progress in enhancing value for the Issuer's
     shareholders and the apparent inability of Management, and its
     recently announced restructuring plan, to address this matter.  The
     Lens Group considers Management's restructuring plan woefully
     inadequate for the Issuer's circumstances and believes the plan has
     received a


                                   Page 6 of 24

<PAGE>
     

     materially negative market reaction.  Shortly after the announcement
     of Management's restructuring plan, Mr. Robert A.G. Monks and Ms. Nell
     Minow of the Lens Group met with Mr. Phillip B. Rooney, Chief
     Executive Officer of the Issuer, and Messrs. Joseph M. Holsten and
     John D. Sanford, the Issuer's recently elected Chief Operating Officer
     and Chief Financial Officer, respectively, to hear from them about
     Management's restructuring plan.  The Lens Group shared with such
     individuals its perception of the inadequacies of the restructuring
     plan and of the market's reaction to the plan as an insufficient
     effort to address shareholder value.

               During the past year the Lens Group has had occasional
     discussions with Mr. George Soros, Mr. Stanley F. Druckenmiller, and
     representatives of Soros Fund Management LLC, ("SFM LLC"), Quantum
     Industrial Partners, LDC, QIH Management Investor, L.P., QIH
     Management, Inc., and Duquesne Capital management, L.L.C.
     (collectively, including SFM LLC, the "Soros Group") concerning
     actions that they may take to enhance the value of their investments
     in the Issuer.  The Lens Group understands that, in the past, the
     Soros Group had attempted to engage the Issuer's Management in
     discussions regarding enhancing shareholder value.  

               In discussions between the Lens Group and the Soros Group on
     February 5, 1997, it was determined that the Lens Group would approach
     the Issuer with a proposal (the "Proposal") that the Issuer's Board
     promptly, and before the next annual meeting of shareholders in May
     1997, elect to the Board two persons who were agreed upon by the Lens
     Group and the Soros Group.  The two persons who were agreed upon were
     Mr. Brian Corvese, a Managing Director of SFM LLC, and Mr. Herbert
     Lanese, former President of McDonnell Douglas Aerospace.  These two
     candidates, in the opinion of the Lens Group and the Soros Group,
     together possess substantial operating and financial experience and
     abilities, and are also sensitive to the need to enhance shareholder
     value.  The Proposal was communicated by Mr. Monks of the Lens Group
     to Dean L. Buntrock, Chairman of the Board of the Issuer, by telephone
     on the afternoon of February 5, 1997.

               The Lens Group was advised by the Soros Group that a
     subsequent telephone conversation occurred that evening between Mr.
     Buntrock and Mr. Druckenmiller.  In that conversation, Mr. Buntrock
     indicated that he was open to suggestions for new Board members and
     that his reaction to the Proposal was that Mr. Corvese would be
     acceptable and that he required more information regarding Mr. Lanese. 
     Further information regarding Mr. Lanese was provided by the Soros
     Group to Mr. Buntrock that evening.

               On the afternoon of February 6, 1997, Dean L. Buntrock, the
     Chairman of the Board, Phillip B. Rooney, the Chief Executive Officer
     and President, and Herbert A. Getz, the Senior Vice President, General
     Counsel and Secretary, of the Issuer, met at the offices of SFM LLC
     with Messrs. Stanley Druckenmiller, Brian Corvese and Robert Jermain,
     all Managing Directors of SFM LLC, as well as with their legal
     advisors.  The Soros Group has informed the Lens Group that at this
     meeting, contrary to the position he had expressed the prior evening,
     Mr. Buntrock indicated that, after considering the Proposal and after
     canvassing the members of the Issuer's Board, he was willing only to
     commit publicly to hiring an executive search firm to identify two
     new, independent candidates to stand for election to the Board at the
     next Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  According to the Soros Group,
     Mr. Buntrock also contradicted his prior statement to Mr.
     Druckenmiller by asserting that Mr. Lanese was suitable for the Board
     but that Mr. Corvese was not.

               The Lens Group understands from discussions with the Soros
     Group that Management's reaction to the Proposal insufficiently
     addressed the concern of the Soros Group that the Issuer's Board of
     Directors could benefit from, and that shareholder value could be
     enhanced by, the immediate presence on the Board of (i) an additional
     member with significant operating experience and the proven ability to
     enhance shareholder value in a large corporate environment and (ii) a
     member with a financial background who is more attuned to shareholders
     and the constituents in the financial markets.  Messrs. Buntrock,
     Rooney and Getz stated that, while the Board would be willing to elect
     two new, independent directors to fill expected vacancies in the Board
     expeditiously and prior to May 1997, the Board was unwilling to
     consider a candidate who was, or could be viewed as being, a designee
     or affiliate of a large shareholder, noting that it was the Board's
     general view that a candidate recommended by a shareholder could not
     be considered "independent" and was incapable of representing the
     interests of the entire shareholder base.  There was further
     discussion of the propriety of and basis, if any, for the Board's
     position.  The meeting ended soon after the Soros Group reiterated its
     belief that a Board member's affiliation with a company's shareholders
     was a positive factor, by no means inconsistent with independence or a
     director's fiduciary duties.

               In the evening of February 6, 1997, Mr. Monks and Mr. John
     Higgins of the Lens Group met with Messrs. Buntrock, Rooney and Getz,
     as well as Mr. Alexander B. Trowbridge, a member of the Board and
     Chairman of the Board's nominating committee.  The discussions that
     transpired were substantially similar to those

     that occurred between the Issuer and the Soros Group earlier in the
     day, but certain additional issues were also discussed.  At the
     meeting with the Lens Group, Mr. Buntrock, contrary to his statements
     made to the Soros Group only hours earlier (as the Lens Group
     understood Mr. Buntrock's discussions with the Soros Group to have
     transpired), expressed concern that Mr. Lanese might not be
     sufficiently independent from the Soros Group.  Also addressed at the
     meeting, among other things, was the Lens Group's concern regarding a
     decision rendered after trial in an action entitled Mark W. Gregory,
                                                         ----------------
     et al. v. Chemical Waste Management, Inc., brought against a
     -----     -------------------------------
     subsidiary of the Issuer.  In findings of fact and conclusions of law
     filed on December 11, 1996, the United States District Court for the
     Western District of Tennessee awarded more than $76 million in
     compensatory damages and $15 million of punitive damages against the
     defendant stating "that fraud, misrepresentation and dishonesty
     apparently became part of the operating culture of the Defendant
     Corporation" and "Defendant undertook significant steps to cover up
     its fraud."  The Lens Group commented critically upon the absence of
     any indication by the Board that it is taking corrective steps with
     respect to the Court's findings other than the Issuer's appealing the
     decision.

               The Lens Group understands from discussions with the Soros
     Group that, in discussions between Mr. Druckenmiller and Mr. Buntrock
     on February 9, 1997, Mr. Druckenmiller modified the Proposal to
     include the removal of Mr. Rooney from the Issuer's management (the
     "Modified Proposal").  It was agreed that Mr. Druckenmiller, Mr.
     Jermain and Mr. Corvese of SFM LLC and a legal advisor would meet with
     members of the Issuer's Board to discuss, among other things, the
     Modified Proposal on Tuesday, February 11, 1997 at the Issuer's
     principal office.  However, because of a concern that the Issuer might
     seek to assert that, under recently amended By-laws of the Issuer, the
     time to nominate directors for election at the 1997 Annual Meeting of
     Shareholders of the Issuer might expire before a resolution concerning
     the Modified Proposal could be reached, after discussion with the Lens
     Group, Quantum Partners, an investment company advised by SFM LLC and
     a shareholder of the Issuer, caused the following persons (the
     "Alternative Slate of Directors") to be nominated, by written notice
     dated February 10, 1997 (the "Nomination Notice"), in accordance with
     requirements set forth in the Issuer's recently amended By-laws for
     election as directors of the Issuer:

                 (i)     Mr. Harvey L. Karp has served as Chairman of the
     Board of Mueller Industries, Inc., a leading fabricator of plastics,
     brass, copper and aluminum products, since 1991.  From 1991 to 1992,
     Mr. Karp also served as Chief Executive Officer of

<PAGE>
     

     Mueller Industries, Inc.  Mr. Karp has served on numerous Boards of
     Directors in the past.  He is 69 years old.

                (ii)     Mr. Herbert J. Lanese is a private investor.  He
     served as President of McDonnell Douglas Aerospace and as a member of
     the office of the Chief Executive of Mcdonnell Douglas Corporation
     from February, 1996 to October, 1996.  Prior to serving as President
     of McDonnell Douglas Aerospace, he served as Deputy President of
     McDonnell Douglas Aerospace from 1995 to 1996 and prior to that time,
     as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of McDonnell
     Douglas Corporation.  Mr. Lanese joined McDonnell Douglas Corporation
     in 1989 as Senior Vice President-Finance.  Mr. Lanese serves on the
     Advisory Board of The Chase Manhattan Bank.

               (iii)     Mr. G. Allen Mebane has served as Chairman of the
     Board of Unifi Inc., a leading textile manufacturer, since 1985.  Mr.
     Mebane is 67 years old.

                (iv)     Mr. Jack H. Nusbaum is a Senior Partner and
     Chairman of the New York law firm of Willkie Farr & Gallagher, where
     he has been a partner for more than twenty-five years.  He is a
     director of W.R. Berkley Corporation, Fine Host Corporation, Strategic
     Distribution, Inc., The Topps Company, Inc., Pioneer Companies, Inc.
     and Prime Hospitality Corp.  He is 56 years old.

     The Lens Group has expressed to the Soros Group its support for the
     Alternative Slate of Directors.

               The Lens Group understands that representatives of the Soros
     Group met on February 11, 1997 for one hour with members of the Board,
     consisting of a majority of the directors, as well as in-house and
     outside counsel to the Issuer, during which these representatives
     explained the Modified Proposal and the various grounds for their
     dissatisfaction with Mr. Rooney.  Although the Board members indicated
     their willingness to accept two new independent Board members, no
     agreement was reached with respect to retention of Mr. Rooney or the
     identity of such new directors.  At the conclusion of the meeting
     those present acknowledged that there had been an exchange of views
     and no agreements or understandings were reached.  

               Following this meeting, on February 11, 1996, SFM LLC
     received a letter from the Issuer stating that the submission by
     Quantum Partners to the Issuer of the Nomination Notice with respect
     to the Alternative Slate of Directors was "not in compliance with the
     Company's By-laws" and that the Alternative Slate of Directors "will
     not be considered at the 1997 Annual



                                   Page 10 of 24

<PAGE>
     

     Meeting."  This letter added that the Board had directed its
     Nominating Committee to "consider the four individuals identified in
     the letter as possible candidates for nomination as directors of the
     [Issuer]."  That day, a representative of the Soros Group also had
     discussions with the Issuer's outside counsel concerning Quantum
     Partners' submission of the nomination of the Alternative Slate of
     Directors and asked that the Issuer reconsider its objections to such
     submission.

               The Lens Group was advised by the Soros Group that, on
     February 12, 1997, SFM LLC, on behalf of Quantum, advised the Issuer
     by letter of the same date that Quantum Partners "believes that the
     Nomination Notice was timely delivered and contained all the
     information required by the Issuer's By-laws."  The letter also states
     Quantum Partners' belief that the interests of the Issuer's
     shareholders are not served by the Issuer's stance regarding the
     Nomination Notice and requested that the Board immediately waive any
     arguable defect with respect to the Nomination Notice.

               The Lens Group believes that the Nomination Notice complied
     with the Issuer's By-laws, as they should be properly applied in the
     circumstances, and that the Alternative Slate of Directors should be
     considered for election at the Issuer's 1997 Annual Meeting of
     Shareholders.  The Lens Group has advised the Soros Group and certain
     other shareholders of the Issuer that it supports the Soros Group in
     seeking to have the Nomination Notice be treated as effective for the
     purpose of nominating the Alternative Slate of Directors.  The Lens
     Group also has advised the Soros Group that it was considering
     bringing to the attention of the Common Shareholders generally,
     through appropriate advertisements, the insufficiency of the Board's
     efforts in providing effective independent director oversight of
     Management.  The Soros Group has advised the Lens Group that the Soros
     Group has discussed this possibility with Management.  This discussion
     produced the exchange of correspondence between Mr. Buntrock and Mr.
     Monks attached to this Statement as an exhibit.

               The Lens Group may continue to pursue the matters discussed
     above through negotiation with the Issuer or through discussions or
     concerted actions with the Soros Group and/or other shareholders of
     the Issuer, including the solicitation of proxies in respect of the
     Strategic Review Proposal and/or the Alternative Slate of Directors.

               Other than in respect of communication of the Proposal and
     the Lens Group's general support of the Alternative Slate of
     Directors, the Lens Group and the Soros Group have not reached

                                   Page 11 of 24

<PAGE>
     

     any definitive agreement or understanding as to any joint efforts to
     enhance the value of their investments in the Issuer or the basis on
     which such efforts might be undertaken.  The Lens Group and the Soros
     Group have engaged and may continue in discussions regarding such
     matter, but there is no assurance that they will develop any such
     agreement or understanding.  The Lens Group does not intend to seek
     control of the Issuer or to participate, except to the extent
     described above, in the management of the Issuer.

               Except as described above, the Lens Group has no plans or
     proposals which relate to, or would result in, any of the transactions
     described in subparagraphs (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D
     under the 1934 Act.  The Lens Group reserves the right, at any time,
     to acquire securities of the Issuer and to dispose of any such
     securities, to cause its clients to acquire additional securities of
     the Issuer or to dispose of any securities of the Issuer any of them
     currently own or any such securities they may hereafter acquire and/or
     to formulate other purposes, plans or proposals regarding the Issuer
     or any of its securities, to the extent deemed advisable by the Lens
     Group in light of the Lens Group's general investment and trading
     policies, market conditions, the interests of its clients, or other
     factors.

     ITEM 5.   INTEREST IN SECURITIES OF THE ISSUER

               (a)(i)    By virtue of their management of Client accounts,
     on February 5, 1996, Focus and Ram were the beneficial owner of
     128,209 and 64,401 shares of Common Stock, respectively (approximately
     0.05% of the Common Stock outstanding), for purposes of Section 13(d)
     of the 1934 Act and, by virtue of their joint management, may also
     have been the beneficial owner of the shares of Common Stock owned by
     the others.  By virtue of their management of client accounts, on the
     date of this Statement, Focus and Ram were the beneficial owner of
     128,209 and 114,041 shares of Common Stock, respectively
     (approximately 0.05% of the outstanding Common Stock), for purposes of
     Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act and, by virtue of this joint management,
     may also have been the beneficial owner of the shares of Common Stock
     owned by the other.  

              (ii)   As a result of their joint sponsorship of the Proposal
     on February 5, 1997, as described in Item 4 of this Statement, the
     Soros Group and the Lens Group may be deemed to have formed a group
     within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the 1934 Act.  The Lens
     Group understands that, as of February 5, 1997 and as of the date of
     this Statement, the Soros Group,



                                   Page 12 of 24



<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

     collectively, may be deemed a beneficial owner of 25,225,100 shares of
     Common Stock (approximately 5.20% of the outstanding Common Stock). 
     The Lens Group disclaims beneficial ownership of any shares of Common
     Stock beneficially owned by the Soros Group.  The Soros Group has
     filed amendments to its Schedule 13D statement respecting the Common
     Stock, dated February 11 and 13, 1997, relating to the matters
     discussed above.

               (b)  Focus had the sole power to direct the vote and the
     disposition of the 128,209 shares of Common Stock (approximately 0.03%
     of the outstanding Common Stock) owned by its Clients in accounts
     managed by it on February 5, 1997 and has the sole power to direct the
     vote and the disposition of the 128,209 shares of Common Stock
     (approximately the same percentage of the outstanding Common Stock)
     owned by its Clients in such accounts on the date of this Statement. 
     Ram had the sole power to direct the vote and the disposition of the
     64,041 shares of Common Stock (approximately 0.01% of the outstanding
     Common Stock) owned by its Clients in accounts managed by it on
     February 5, 1997 and has the sole power to direct the vote and the
     disposition of the 114,041 shares of Common Stock (approximately the
     same percentage of the outstanding Common Stock) owned by its Clients
     in such accounts on the date of this Statement.

               The percentages of outstanding shares of Common Stock used
     in this Statement are calculated based upon the 485,121,646 shares of
     Common Stock stated by the Issuer to be issued and outstanding at
     October 31, 1996, as reflected in the Issuer's Quarterly Report on
     Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 1996.

               (c)  Except for causing the open market transactions for
     Client accounts listed in Schedule III hereto, there have been no
     transactions with respect to the Common Stock during the past 60 days
     by the Lens Group.

               (d)  No person other than the Client who is the owner of
     shares of Common Stock referred to herein is known to the Lens Group
     to have the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of
     dividends from or the proceeds of sale of any of the shares of Common
     Stock referred to in Item 5(a)(i) hereof.

               (e)  Not applicable.

     ITEM 6.   CONTRACTS, ARRANGEMENTS, UNDERSTANDINGS, OR RELATIONSHIPS
               WITH RESPECT TO SECURITIES OF THE ISSUER

               As discussed in Item 4 of this Statement, the Lens Group and
     Mr. Kenneth Steiner, an unaffiliated shareholder of the Issuer, have
     jointly sponsored under Rule 14a-8 under the 1934 Act the Strategic
     Review Proposal for a vote by Common Shareholders at the Issuer's 1997
     Annual Meeting of Shareholders.

               As part of their respective Client relationships, Focus and
     Ram have the power to direct the voting and the disposition of shares
     of Common Stock owned by their respective Clients in the accounts they
     manage for the Clients, pursuant to written investment management
     agreements with the Clients.  Under such agreements, Focus's
     compensation for its services thereunder may include a share in the
     appreciation earned by the Client on the account's investments and
     accordingly both Focus's and Ram's compensation for its services
     thereunder may vary with the value of the assets (including any Common
     Stock) under its management.  None of such agreements, however,
     require that such accounts be invested in securities of the Issuer or
     include in their provisions any terms specifically relating to or
     varying with the investment of the accounts in securities of the
     Issuer.

               Focus also provides investment advisory services to clients
     with respect to client accounts over which it has not been provided
     under its respective agreement with the client the power to direct the
     voting or disposition of securities in the accounts.  One of such
     "advisory-only" clients of Focus has acquired shares of Common Stock
     in its Focus-advised account, which as of February 5, 1997 held
     140,000 shares of Common Stock and as of the date hereof held 150,000
     shares of Common Stock.  Under Focus's agreement with such client,
     Focus's compensation for its advisory services thereunder includes a
     share of the appreciation (if any) earned by the client on the
     account's investments in excess of the appreciation in a market index. 
     Such agreement, however, does not include in its provisions any terms
     specifically relating to or varying with the investment of the account
     in securities of the Issuer.

               Focus and Ram have entered into, on behalf of clients,
     financial derivative contracts, in the nature of call options,
     relating to shares of Common Stock.  With respect to clients of Focus,
     such contracts as of the date hereof related to 45,000 shares of
     Common Stock and, with respect to Ram, such contracts as of the date
     hereof related to 118,000 shares of Common Stock.  Such contracts
     provide for settlement in cash only and do not





                                   Page 14 of 24


<PAGE>

<PAGE>
     

     provide to Focus or Ram any right to acquire shares of Common Stock or
     any right to direct the acquisition, disposition or voting by the
     counterparty of shares of Common Stock.  The amount of the cash
     settlement payments to become due under such contracts depend on the
     market value of shares of Common Stock upon expiration of the
     contracts, which as to 150,000 shares is February 6, 1998 and as to
     13,000 shares is May 9, 1997 (or earlier upon the occurrence of an
     event of default under the contracts).  The counterparty of the
     contracts is Bankers Trust Company of New York or an affiliate
     thereof.

               The Lens Group and the Soros Group have acted together
     regarding the Proposal as described in Item 4 of this Statement and,
     as a result, the Lens Group and the Soros Group may be deemed to be a
     group for purposes of Section 13(d)(3) of the 1934 Act.

     ITEM 7.   MATERIAL TO BE FILED AS EXHIBITS.

               1.   Letter dated February 11, 1997 from Dean L. Buntrock,

                    Rooney, Chief Executive Officer, of the Issuer, to

     Mr. Robert A.G. Monks
     Lens
     45 Exchange Street, Suite 400
     Portland, Maine 04101

     Dear Mr. Monks:

     You have stated in your promotional materials that you use the press
     as a weapon.  And for the past week you have been threatening to run
     an ad critical of the Company in The Wall Street Journal, as well as
     undertake other initiatives, if we didn't meet your demands.  But we
     will not allow our shareholders to be shortchanged over the long-term
     in order to save ourselves the discomfort of negative publicity.

     During our two meetings with you last week it became increasingly
     clear that you were less interested in understanding the rationale
     behind our newly focused business strategy -- much of which you have
     been advocating for some time -- and more interested in using threats
     as leverage to get us to agree to your suggestions for two Board
     seats.

     We have listened to your suggestions.  This is obvious given the fact
     that the appointment of Paul Montrone as a new director, which we
     announced last week, came directly from a list of suggested candidates
     that you submitted last Fall to Alexander Trowbridge, Chairman of the
     Board's Nominating Committee.

     We have been engaged in a search to find candidates with the right
     experience, independent perspective and thoughtful, long-term business
     judgment who can serve the interests of all WMX shareholders.  We
     believe that is the critical objective and that our shareholders would
     want us to do no less.  

     WMX is clearly changing.  And fast.  We have a focused business
     strategy for profitable growth -- a comprehensive plan to deliver

     value to shareholders quickly and effectively, but we are determined
     to move ahead with the best plan, and the best directors.  As
     fiduciaries for all WMX shareholders, we won't settle for anything
     less.

     Very truly yours,


     /s/ Dean L. Buntrock                    /s/ Phillip B. Rooney

     Dear Dean and Phil,

     I am sorry to receive your letter of February 11, because it
     introduces elements of mischaracterization and personal attack
     previously absent in our communications.  I have been glad of the

     ability to speak directly and honestly with you, despite our
     differences.  Your letter marks a different course of "spinning" for
     the record.

     After several months of intensive consideration, WMX management came
     up with a proposed solution to the company's admittedly very serious
     problems that involved the addition of not one new person at a senior
     level (Paul Montrone, notwithstanding his outstanding ability can
     hardly be considered an outsider).  The market has responded with a
     clear rejection of your plan.  That is the source of the negative
     publicity.

     In a company with a performance record like that of WMX, the market
     (and the press) can be expected to be skeptical when a company so
     thoroughly insulates itself from any outside perspective.  The pattern
     of WMX, from the history of insiders, former insiders, and service
     providers on the board to the "confidential voting" policy that is
     more loophole than substance, supports these concerns.  We have seen,
     at other companies, strong market approval when companies bring in
     independent outsiders with demonstrated track records.  Should you
     find, in your search for new directors, that highly qualified
     candidates are reluctant to accept nomination in the context of
     shareholder dissent, I encourage you to have them meet with us and the
     Soros representatives, in the hope that we can achieve some solution
     short of proxy contest.  In the meantime, we will continue to
     communicate our concerns to you and to other shareholders until we are
     persuaded that they have been heard and substantively addressed.

     Respectfully yours,


     /s/ Robert A.G. Monks
