filing a joint Schedule 13D.

securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws.

Item 3.  Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.

         The  aggregate  purchase  price of the shares of Common  Stock owned by

a discretionary  basis,  certain of the Fund's assets, which are maintained in a
brokerage account in the Fund's name. The Management Agreement may be terminated

Fund may be deemed the beneficial owner of the Shares reported by Services.

ITEM 4.  PURPOSE OF TRANSACTION.

         The Reporting  Persons believe that the shares of the Issuer at current

appreciation.

         No Reporting Person has any present plan or proposal which would relate
to or result in any of the matters set forth in subparagraphs  (a) (j) of Item 4

continuing  basis  and,   depending  on  various  factors   including,   without
limitation,  the Issuer's  business  affairs and financial  position,  the price
levels of the Common  Stock,  conditions in the  securities  markets and general
