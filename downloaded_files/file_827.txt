<PAGE> 3

Item 1.       Security and Issuer

This Amendment No. 1 to Schedule 13D (the "Amendment") relates to the
Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Shares"), of Lifecell
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Issuer" or "LifeCell").  The
Issuer's principal executive offices are located at 3606 Research Forest
Drive, The Woodlands, Texas 77381.

Item 2.       Identity and Background

This Amendment is being filed by CS First Boston, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("CSFBI"), as an amendment to and restatement of the Schedule
13D filed by CSFBI on May 19, 1994, with respect to Shares held directly by
1985 MIP Liquidating Trust (the "Trust"), successor to 1985 Merchant
Investment Partnership, a New York limited partnership ("1985 MIP"). 
Merchant GP, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSFBI ("Merchant GP") and
formerly the sole General Partner of 1985 MIP, is currently the sole
Trustee of the Trust.

CSFBI is a holding company whose subsidiaries are principally engaged in
the business of investment banking, broker-dealer and asset management
activities.  The principal office and business address for CSFBI, Merchant
GP and the Trust is Park Avenue Plaza, 55 East 52nd Street, New York, New
York 10055.  CSFBI, Merchant GP and the Trust are referred to herein
collectively as the "CS First Boston Entities".

All of the outstanding voting common stock of CSFBI and approximately 69%
of the outstanding non-voting common stock of CSFBI are owned by CS
Holding, a Swiss corporation having its registered offices at
Nueschelerstrasse 1, CH-8021 Zurich, Switzerland.  The principal business
of CS Holding is acting as a holding company for a group of companies in
the financial services and energy business offering a comprehensive range
of products.  Through its ownership of common stock of CSFBI, CS Holding,
for purposes of the federal securities laws, may be deemed to ultimately
control CSFBI.  CS Holding, its executive officers and directors and its
direct and indirect subsidiaries, in addition to the CS First Boston
Entities, may beneficially own Shares of the Issuer and such Shares are not
reported in this Statement.  CS Holding disclaims beneficial ownership of
Shares beneficially owned by its direct and indirect subsidiaries,
including the CS First Boston Entities.  CSFBI hereby undertakes to amend
this Statement, if necessary, to include the information required by Items
3 through 6 of Schedule 13D with respect to any Shares that may be
beneficially owned by the executive officers or directors of CS Holding.

The name, citizenship, residence or business address, and present principal
occupation or employment, and the name, principal business and address of
any corporation or other organization in which such employment is
conducted, of each executive officer and director of CSFBI, Merchant GP and
CS Holding are set forth on Schedule I hereto, which Schedule is hereby
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.  The Trust has no
executive officers or directors.

None of the CS First Boston Entities and, to the knowledge of CSFBI,
neither CS Holding nor any of the executive officers and directors listed
on Schedule I hereto, has, during the last five years, (i) been convicted
in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar
misdemeanors) or (ii) been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or
administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such
proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining
future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to,
federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to
such laws.

<PAGE> 4


Item 3.     Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration

Not Applicable.  

Item 4.     Purpose of Transaction

On March 11, 1994, CSFBI acquired 128,705 Shares of LifeCell pursuant to an
arbitration award.

Pursuant to an Agreement of Trust, dated December 22, 1995 (the "Agreement
of Trust"), between 1985 MIP and Merchant GP, the Trust was established for
the sole purpose of liquidating the assets of 1985 MIP, including the
Shares held by it, and distributing the proceeds therefrom in accordance
with the terms of the Agreement of Trust.  Pursuant to the Agreement of
Trust, 1985 MIP appointed Merchant GP as sole trustee of the Trust and
conveyed the Shares held by 1985 MIP to the Trust.

The CS First Boston Entities do not currently have any plans or proposals
which would relate to or result in any of the transactions set forth in
paragraphs (a) through (j) of Item 4 to Schedule 13D, although they may in
the future engage in some or all of the transactions therein described.

The CS First Boston Entities may engage in further purchases of Shares from
time to time and may sell Shares at any time and from time to time.

The foregoing summary of the Agreement of Trust is qualified in its
entirety by the Agreement of Trust, which is filed as an exhibit hereto and
incorporated by reference into this Item 4.

Item 5.     Interest in Securities of the Issuer

As of July 12, 1996:

      (a)    CSFBI may be deemed to beneficially own 160,412 Shares, which
             constitutes approximately 3.643% of the outstanding Shares. 
             CSFBI may be deemed to have sole dispositive power with
             respect to 160,412 Shares; has shared dispositive power with
             respect to none of the Shares and has sole or shared voting
             power with respect to none of the Shares.

      (b)    Merchant GP beneficially owns 160,412 Shares, which
             constitutes approximately 3.643% of the outstanding Shares. 
             Pursuant to an Asset Management Agreement, dated as of March
             6, 1991, among Merchant GP, CSFBI, The Clipper Group, L.P.
             ("Clipper") and other parties thereto, including all
             amendments thereto, Clipper has sole voting power with respect
             to 160,412 of the Shares; and has shared voting power with
             respect to none of the Shares.  Merchant GP has sole
             dispositive power with respect to 160,412 of the Shares; and
             has shared dispositive power with respect to none of the
             Shares.  The terms of the Agreement were confirmed by a Letter
             Agreement, dated December 20, 1995, between Merchant GP and
             Clipper.

      (c)    On June 10, 1996, the CS First Boston Entities ceased to
             beneficially own 5% of the outstanding Shares.

      (d)    Other than the transactions set forth in Schedule 2 hereto,
             there has been no transactions in the Shares by the CS First
             Boston Entities during the past 60 days.  To the best
             knowledge of CSFBI, none of the executive officers and
             directors listed in 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 5

Parts A through C of Schedule I hereto has effected any transactions in the
Shares in the past 60 days.

Item 6.     Contracts, Arrangements, Understanding or
            Relationships with Respect to Securities
            of the Issuer.

             The Agreement of Trust is filed as an exhibit hereto and
incorporated into this Item 6 by reference.  See Item 4.

                         1985 MIP LIQUIDATING TRUST

                             AGREEMENT OF TRUST


            THIS Agreement of Trust creating the 1985 MIP LIQUIDATING
TRUST, and related SUBTRUST A and SUBTRUST B, dated as of December 22,
1995, is made and entered into by and between 1985 MERCHANT INVESTMENT
PARTNERSHIP (the "Partnership") and MERCHANT GP, INC. (the "Trustee").

            WHEREAS, the Partnership by its terms terminates on
December 31, 1995;

            WHEREAS, as of the date above, the Partnership holds the assets
listed on Schedule 1 (the "Subtrust A Assets") and Schedule 2 (the
"Subtrust B Assets") (collectively, the "Trust Assets"); and

            WHEREAS, the Trustee is willing to hold (i) the Subtrust A
Assets in trust for the benefit of those persons who are partners of the
Partnership as of the date above and who have an interest in the Subtrust A
Assets as set forth in Schedule 3 (the "Subtrust A Beneficiaries"), and
(ii) the Subtrust B Assets in trust for the benefit of those persons who
are partners of the Partnership as of the date above and who have an
interest in the Subtrust B Assets as set forth in Schedule 4 (the
"Subtrust B Beneficiaries");

            NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
covenants and agreements contained herein, the Partnership and the Trustee
agree as follows:

            1.    Establishment of 1985 MIP LIQUIDATING TRUST and related
SUBTRUST A and SUBTRUST B.  The Partnership hereby conveys, sets over,
assigns and delivers to the Trustee, without the reservation of any
interest of any nature, the Trust Assets, and the Trustee agrees to accept
and hold (i) the Subtrust A Assets in trust for the Subtrust A
Beneficiaries, and their successors and assigns, in accordance with each
individual beneficiary's respective interest in the Subtrust A Assets as of
the date above, as set forth in Schedule 3, and (ii) the Subtrust B Assets
in trust for the Subtrust B Beneficiaries, and their successors and
assigns, in accordance with each individual beneficiary's respective
interest in the Subtrust B Assets as of the date above, as set forth in
Schedule 4.

            2.    Purpose of 1985 MIP LIQUIDATING TRUST; Powers of Trustee. 
The trust (the "1985 MIP LIQUIDATING TRUST") and related subtrusts
("SUBTRUST A" and "SUBTRUST B") created hereby are created solely for the 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 2

purpose of liquidating the Trust Assets and distributing the proceeds
therefrom in a timely manner in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section
301.7701-4(d), and shall have no objective to continue or engage in the
conduct of a trade or business.  In furtherance of the foregoing, the
Trustee shall have such powers, which shall be exercisable without the
consent of the Subtrust A Beneficiaries and Subtrust B Beneficiaries
(collectively, the "Trust Beneficiaries"), to perform any and all acts
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of the 1985 MIP
LIQUIDATING TRUST, and related SUBTRUST A and SUBTRUST B, including but not
limited to, any and all acts necessary or desirable to conserve, maintain
and manage the Trust Assets pending their sale or liquidation, without any
responsibility or liability for any depreciation or loss by or on account
of the Trust Assets, and to distribute at least annually to the Trust
Beneficiaries, their successors and assigns, in accordance with their
respective interests set forth in Schedules 3 and 4, any proceeds from the
sale or other liquidation of the Trust Assets, any amounts of cash
distributed in respect of the Trust Assets and any other cash held as part
of the 1985 MIP LIQUIDATING TRUST estate (in its entirety, the "Trust
Estate") in excess of the 1985 MIP LIQUIDATING TRUST's expenses; and to
hold any cash to be distributed in connection with the Trust Estate as part
of the Trust Estate until distributed to the Trust Beneficiaries as herein
provided; provided, however, that the Trustee shall not have the power to
vary the nature of the assets of the Trust Estate beyond its current
composition, cash, demand and time deposits in banks or savings
institutions, repurchase agreements, including reverse repurchase
agreements, and temporary investments such as short-term certificates of
deposit or Treasury bills.

            3.    Dissolution; Disposition of Trust Assets.  Prior to
termination of the 1985 MIP LIQUIDATING TRUST, and related SUBTRUST A and
SUBTRUST B, the Trustee shall distribute any remaining Trust Assets to the
Trust Beneficiaries, their successors and ensigns, in accordance with their
respective interests, as set forth in Schedules 3 and 4, in the Subtrust A
Assets and Subtrust B Assets, respectively.  SUBTRUST A will terminate and
dissolve upon the earlier to occur of (i) liquidation of the SubTrust A
Assets and distribution of the proceeds therefrom to the SubTrust A
Beneficiaries, their successors and assigns, and (ii) the third anniversary
hereof; provided, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the 1985 MIP
LIQUIDATING TRUST, and related SUBTRUST A, shall terminate and dissolve,
and the SubTrust A Assets shall be promptly distributed, in the event of
any voluntary or involuntary judicial filing of bankruptcy by or with
respect to MERCHANT GP, INC. under the laws of the United States or any of
its political subdivisions.  SUBTRUST B will terminate and dissolve upon
the earlier to occur of (i) liquidation of the SubTrust B Assets and
distribution of the proceeds therefrom to the SubTrust B Beneficiaries,
their successors and assigns, and (ii) the third anniversary hereof;
provided, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the 1985 MIP LIQUIDATING
TRUST, and related SUBTRUST B, shall terminate and dissolve, and the
SubTrust B Assets shall be promptly distributed, in the event of any
voluntary or involuntary judicial

<PAGE> 3

filing of bankruptcy by or with respect to MERCHANT GP, INC. under the laws
of the United States or any of its political subdivisions.

            4.    Payment of Expenses and Claims against the 1985 MIP
LIQUIDATING TRUST.  The Trustee shall pay all expenses incurred in
connection with the formation and administration of the 1985 MIP
LIQUIDATING TRUST out of the assets of the 1985 MIP LIQUIDATING TRUST,
including, without limitation, expenses incurred for the maintenance and
protection of the Trust Assets, taxes, expenses incurred in communicating
with the Trust Beneficiaries, legal, accounting and other expenses incurred
by the Trustee in connection with the performance of its obligations
hereunder.  Expenses shall be allocated between the Subtrust A Assets and
the Subtrust B Assets as determined by the Trustee in its sole and absolute
discretion.

            5.    Transfer of Beneficial Interests.  The interests of the
Trust Beneficiaries in the 1985 MIP LIQUIDATING TRUST, which are reflected
only on the records of the 1985 MIP LIQUIDATING TRUST, are not negotiable
and shall be assignable only pursuant to applicable laws of descent and
distribution.

            6.    Obligations of Trustee.  The Trustee shall have only such
affirmative obligations as are provided for in this Agreement of Trust or
as may be required by law.

            7.    Indemnification of Trustee.  The Trustee shall be
indemnified by and receive reimbursement from the Trust Estate against and
from any and all loss, liability, expense, or damage which the Trustee may
occur or sustain, in the exercise and performance of any of the powers and
duties of the Trustee under this Agreement of Trust, except for any such
loss, liability, expense or damage that results from the gross negligence
or willful misconduct of the Trustee.  In the event that the Trust Estate
has been wholly or partially distributed, each Trust Beneficiary shall
refund to the Trustee his proportionate share of all such loss, liability,
expense or damage as to which the Trustee is entitled to indemnity or
reimbursement; provided, however, that the liability of each Such Trust
Beneficiary shall not exceed the amount distributed to such Trust
Beneficiary from the Trust Estate.

            8.    Miscellaneous.  This Agreement of Trust shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York
(without regard for the conflicts of laws provisions thereof) and shall
bind and inure to the benefit of

the Trustee, the Trust Beneficiaries and the respective successors and
assigns of the foregoing.

      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement
of Trust as of the date set forth above.
