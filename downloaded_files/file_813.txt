                  This Amendment No. 8 amends and supplements the Statement on
Schedule 13D (the "Schedule 13D") filed by California Public Employees'
Retirement System ("CalPERS"), a governmental employee pension fund, which is a
unit of the State and Consumer Services Agency of the State of California, with
respect to the common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock") of
Catellus Development Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Issuer").
Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Amendment No. 8 have the meanings
given to such terms in the Schedule 13D.

Item 2.           Identity and Background.

                  Information with respect to persons identified in Schedule A
of Item 2 is amended as follows:

                  Information concerning the current executive officers and
members of the Board of Administration of CalPERS is set forth in Schedule A to
this Amendment No. 8. Each of such executive officers and members of the Board
of Administration is a citizen of the United States.

                  To the best of the knowledge of the filing persons, no person
named in Schedule A to this Amendment No. 8 during the last five years (i) has
been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and
similar misdemeanors); or (ii) has been a party to a civil proceeding of a
judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of
such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining
future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal
or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws.

Item 4.           Purpose of the Transaction.

                  Item 4 is amended by adding to the end thereof the following

CalPERS converted a total of 1,405,702 shares of the $3.75 Series A Cumulative
Convertible Preferred Stock of the Issuer (the "Series A Preferred Stock") into
7,757,645 shares of the Common Stock. CalPERS also received an aggregate of
$18.42 in cash in lieu of fractional shares.

                  In July 1996, the Issuer called for redemption 950,000 shares
or approximately $50 million of the Series A Preferred Stock. On September 13,

                               September 19, 1996



Mr. David J. Gilbert
Sr. Real Estate Investment Officer
California Public Employees' Retirement System
400 P Street, Room 3492
Sacramento, California  95814

Dear Mr. Gilbert:

         In my capacity as the Chief Financial Officer of the Catellus
Development Corporation ("Catellus"), you have advised me that you need
additional financial material and data to assist you in connection with
formulating your advice with respect to certain investment decisions pertaining
to Catellus now confronting CalPERS. In particular, CalPERS is considering
whether to elect to tender a portion of the Catellus Series A Convertible Common
Preferred Stock for partial redemption or to elect to convert that stock into
Catellus Common Preferred Stock. To assist you in analyzing these matters on
behalf of CalPERS, you have requested that we supply you with valuation
materials concerning certain of Catellus' properties. Those matters are
contained in a binder which we have prepared dated September 9, 1996 (the
"Binder").

         In order to induce Catellus to deliver the Binder to you, you hereby
agree that you shall not disclose any information in the Binder to third
parties, if it is not public knowledge. You also agree that you will only use
the information contained in the Binder in connection with the above-referenced
investment decisions. Finally, you agree that you will not make copies of the
materials in the Binder, except if Catellus so authorizes in writing. You also
agree that you will return the Binder and any copies thereof to Catellus upon
your completion of the analysis referenced above.

                                Very truly yours,


                                By:   /s/ Stephen P. Wallace
