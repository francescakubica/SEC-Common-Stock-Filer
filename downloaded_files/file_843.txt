Item 1.   Security and Issuer
          This Amendment No. 3 to Schedule 13D on the Common Stock
of Eastern Enterprises (the "Issuer") is being filed on behalf of
the undersigned to amend the Schedule 13D which was originally
filed on October 30, 1992. Unless otherwise indicated, all
capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein shall have the
same meaning as set forth in the Schedule 13D.

Item 2.   Identity and Background
          This statement is being filed by Mario J. Gabelli ("Mr.
Gabelli") and various entities which he directly or indirectly
controls or for which he acts as chief investment officer.  These
entities, except for Lynch Corporation ("Lynch"), Spinnaker
Industries, Incorporated ("Spinnaker"), Western New Mexico
Telephone Company ("Western New Mexico"), Entoleter, Inc. ("Entole-
ter"),  Lynch Telecommunications Corporation ("Lynch Telecom"),
Lynch Telephone Corporation ("Lynch Telephone") and Inter-Community
Telephone Company ("Inter-Community") (collectively, "Lynch and its
affiliates"), engage in various aspects of the securities business,
primarily as investment adviser to various institutional and
individual clients, including registered investment companies and
pension plans, as broker/dealer and as general partner of various
private investment partnerships.  Certain of these entities may
also make investments for their own accounts. 
          The foregoing persons in the aggregate often own
beneficially more than 5% of a class of equity securities of a
particular issuer.  Although several of the foregoing persons are
treated as institutional investors for purposes of reporting their
beneficial ownership on the short-form Schedule 13G, the holdings
of those who do not qualify as institutional investors may exceed
the 1% threshold presented for filing on Schedule 13D or implemen-
tation of their investment philosophy may from time to time require
action which could be viewed as not completely passive.  In order
to avoid any question as to whether their beneficial ownership is
being reported on the proper form and in order to provide greater
investment flexibility and administrative uniformity, these persons
have decided to file their beneficial ownership reports on the more
detailed Schedule 13D form rather than on the short-form Schedule
13G and thereby to provide more expansive disclosure than may be
necessary. 
          (a), (b) and (c) - This statement is being filed by one
or more of the following persons: Gabelli Funds, Inc. ("GFI"),
GAMCO Investors, Inc. ("GAMCO"), Gabelli Securities, Inc. ("GSI"),

Partnership L.P. ("GPP"), GLI, Inc. ("GLI"), Gabelli Associates
Fund ("Gabelli Associates"), Gabelli Associates Limited ("GAL"),
Gabelli & Company, Inc. Profit Sharing Plan (the "Plan"), Gabelli
International Limited ("GIL"), Gabelli International II Limited
("GIL II"), Gabelli International Gold Fund Limited ("GIGFL"), ALCE
Partners, L.P. ("ALCE"), Gabelli Multimedia Partners, L.P.
("Multimedia Partners"), Gabelli Asset Management Company Interna-
tional Advisory Services Ltd. ("GIASL"),Gabelli Foundation, Inc.

          (d) and (e) -  On December 8, 1994, the SEC instituted 
and simultaneously accepted offers for the settlement of an
administrative proceeding against Gabelli & Company and GAMCO.  The
order instituting the proceeding included a finding, which Gabelli

to implement and maintain policies and procedures reasonably
designed to prevent the misuse of material, nonpublic information
by not sepecifically addressing the special circumstances that
arose from their affiliation with Lynch Corporation, a public
company.  To resolve this matter, Gabelli & Company and GAMCO
agreed to cease and desist from violating Section 15(f) of the 1934
Act and Section 204A of the Advisers Act, respectively.  They
further agreed to each pay a civil penalty in the amount of
$50,000, and to retain, and adopt the recommendations of, an
independant consultant regarding their Section 15(f) and Section
204A policies and procedures.
