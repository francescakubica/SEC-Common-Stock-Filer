ITEM 4.   Purpose of Transaction

     Elliott has accumulated its shares of Series B
Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock ("Preferred Stock"),

trade or business of purchasing, selling, trading and
investing in securities.  Depending upon market conditions
and other factors that it may deem material, Elliott may
purchase additional shares of Preferred or Common Stock or

Stock that it now owns or may hereafter acquire.  

     Pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of
Designations for the Preferred Stock, the holders of the
Preferred Stock are entitled to elect four directors to the
Issuer's Board of Directors at the Issuer's annual meeting
of stockholders, which was held on May 2, 1996 (the "Annual
Meeting").  In its April 2, 1996 proxy statement to
stockholders, the Issuer's Board of Directors included its
four nominees to serve as the directors elected by Preferred
Stock.  In accordance with prior notice sent to the Issuer,
Elliott's designee nominated Charles MacDonald at the Annual
Meeting to be one of the directors of the Issuer elected by
the Preferred Stock.  At the Annual Meeting, Elliott's

by Elliott to vote 1,312,921 shares of Preferred Stock held
by other parties, in favor of Mr. MacDonald's election, as
well as for the Issuer's nominees, other than one and Mr.
MacDonald and such nominees were elected to the Issuer's
Board of Directors.

proposals which relate to or would result in any of the
actions set forth in subparagraphs (a) through (j) of Item
