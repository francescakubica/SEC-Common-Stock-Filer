                         AMENDMENT NO. 1 to SCHEDULE 13D

     This amended  statement  relates to shares of Common Stock,  $.01 par value
per share,  (the  "Common  Stock") of Universal  Hospital  Services,  Inc.  (the
"Issuer" or the "Company"). Wynnefield Partners Small Cap Value, L.P., a limited
partnership  formed under the laws of Delaware  (the  "Partnership"),  initially
filed this statement on behalf of the Partnership and Channel  Partnership II, a
limited   partnership   formed   under  the  laws  of  New  Jersey   ("Channel")
(collectively, the "Reporting Persons") on December 13, 1996 to report ownership
of shares of the Common Stock. This Amendment No. 1, effectively  terminates the
Section  13(d)  reporting  obligations  of the  Reporting  Persons  because  the
Reporting  Persons,  both  individually  and  collectively,  are  currently  the
beneficial  owners of less than 5% of the Common  Stock.  This  Amendment  No. 1
amends and supplements Items 3, 4, 5, and 7 of the initial Schedule 13D filed by
the Reporting Persons.

Item 3.  Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration

     No change except for the addition of the following:

     The Partnership  sold 25,000 shares of Common Stock for $429,688 in cash on
March 21, 1997,  and sold 100,000  shares of Common Stock for $1,712,500 in cash
on March 24, 1997.

Item 4.  Purpose of Transaction

     Item 4 is amended and restated as follows:

     At the time the  Reporting  Persons  filed their  initial  Schedule  13D on
December 13, 1996 with respect to the Common Stock,  the Reporting  Persons were
concerned  with certain  actions taken by the Issuer's  Board of Directors.  The
Reporting Persons no longer hold the concerns  expressed in the initial Schedule
13D. As explained in Item 5(e), the Partnership  recently sold 125,000 shares of
Common  Stock,  bringing  the  Reporting  Persons'  percentage  ownership of the
outstanding Common Stock below 5%.

     The Reporting  Persons do not have any present intention to take any action
with respect to the matters  listed in items (b) through (j) of this Item 4. The
Reporting  Persons may each  dispose of or acquire  additional  shares of Common
Stock.   The  Reporting   Persons  each  intend  to  exercise  their  rights  as
shareholders  to vote  for or  against  any  matter  in  accordance  with  their
respective best interests.

Item 5.  Interest in Securities of the Issuer

         Item 5 (a) is amended and restated as follows:

     (a) According to the Issuer's Form 10-Q for the period ending September 30,
1996, as of October 31, 1996,  the Issuer had issued and  outstanding  5,357,218
shares of Common Stock.

     The  Partnership is the  beneficial  owner of 138,000 shares or 2.6% of the
outstanding  Common Stock.  Channel is the  beneficial  owner of 5,700 shares or
0.1% of the outstanding Common Stock.

     The  Reporting  Persons may  constitute a group for purposes of  Regulation
13D.  As a member of a group,  each of the  Reporting  Persons  may be deemed to
beneficially  own the shares of Common Stock  beneficially  owned by each of the
other Reporting  Persons,  which in the aggregate is 143,700 of the total shares
or 2.7% of the Common Stock outstanding.

     Neither the filing of this  Schedule 13D nor any of its  contents  shall be
deemed to constitute an admission  that any Reporting  Person is the  beneficial
owner of any of the shares of Common Stock owned by another Reporting Person for
purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act or for any other purpose, and such
beneficial ownership is expressly disclaimed.

     (b) No change.

     (c) Item 5(c) is amended and restated as follows:

     During the past sixty days, the following  transactions in the Common Stock
were effected:

     On March 21, 1997, the  Partnership  sold 25,000 shares of Common Stock for
$429,688. On March 24, 1997, the Partnership sold 100,000 shares of Common Stock
for $1,712,500.

     (d) No change.

     (e) Item 5(d) is amended and restated as follows:

     On March 21, 1997,  due to the  Partnership's  sale of 25,000 shares of the
Common Stock, the Reporting  Persons ceased to be the beneficial  owners of five
percent of the Common Stock.

Item 7.  Material to Be Filed as Exhibits

     Item 7 is amended and restated as follows:

     Exhibit A - Joint Filing  Agreement  (incorporated  by  reference  from the
initial Schedule 13D)



Signature

     After  reasonable  inquiry and to the best of my  knowledge  and belief,  I
certify that the information  set forth in this statement is true,  complete and
correct.

Dated:            March 31, 1997
