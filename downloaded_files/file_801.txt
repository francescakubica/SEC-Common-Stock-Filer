ITEM 3.   SOURCE AND AMOUNT OF FUNDS OR OTHER CONSIDERATION. 

      The net investment cost (including commissions, if any) of the shares of

Account is $13,448,650.03, $18,181,127.82 and $1,120,636.16, respectively.
      The shares of Common Stock purchased by Vinik Partners were purchased 
with the investment capital of the entity.  The shares of Common Stock
purchased on behalf of Vinik Overseas and the Discretionary Account were 
purchased with their investment capital.  
      The shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by Vinik Partners, Vinik 
Overseas and the Discretionary Account are held in margin accounts maintained 
at Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, which accounts may from time to time 
have debit balances.  Since other securities are held in such margin accounts, 
it is not possible to determine the amounts, if any, of margin used with 
respect to the shares of Common Stock purchased.  Currently, the interest rate 
charged on such various margin accounts is approximately 6.0% per annum.

ITEM 4.   PURPOSE OF THE TRANSACTION.

      The Reporting Persons acquired the shares of Common Stock for investment 
purposes, and the Reporting Persons intend to evaluate the performance of such 
securities as an investment in the ordinary course of business.  The Reporting 
Persons pursue an investment objective that seeks capital appreciation.  In 
pursuing this investment objective, the Reporting Persons analyze the 
operations, capital structure and markets of companies in which they invest, 
including the Company, on a continuous basis through analysis of documentation 
and discussions with knowledgeable industry and market observers and with 
representatives of such companies (often at the invitation of management).  
      Each Reporting Person will continuously assess the Company's business, 
financial condition, results of operations and prospects, general economic 
conditions, the securities markets in general and those for the Company's 
securities in particular, other developments and other investment 
opportunities.  Depending on such assessments, one or more of the Reporting 
Persons may acquire additional shares of Common Stock or may determine to 
sell or otherwise dispose of all or some of its holdings of shares of Common 
Stock.  Such actions will depend upon a variety of factors, including, 
without limitation, current and anticipated future trading prices for such 
Common Stock, the financial condition, results of operations and prospects of
the Company, alternate investment opportunities, and general economic, 
financial market and industry conditions.  
      None of the Reporting Persons has any plans or proposals which relate 
to, or could result in, any of the matters referred to in paragraphs (a) 
through (j), inclusive, of Item 4 of Schedule 13D.

ITEM 5.   INTEREST IN SECURITIES OF THE ISSUER. 

      (a)   The approximate aggregate percentage of shares of Common Stock
reported beneficially owned by each person herein is based on 16,940,774 
outstanding shares of Common Stock (and, where noted, 25,942,248 which 
reflects outstanding shares of Class A and Class B shares of common stock) 
outstanding as of December 20, 1996, as reflected in the Company's quarterly 
report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 
"Commission") for the quarterly period ended November 30, 1996 (which is the 
most recent Form 10-Q on file).

      As of the close of business on February 20, 1997:

            (i)   Vinik Partners owns beneficially 584,500 shares of Common
Stock, constituting approximately 3.5% (2.3%)* of the shares outstanding.
            (ii)  VAM LP owns directly no shares of Common Stock.  By
reason of the provisions of Rule 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the "Act"), VAM LP may be deemed to own beneficially 776,000
shares (constituting approximately 4.5% (3.0%)* of the shares outstanding) 
held by Vinik Overseas, and 47,500 shares of Common Stock (constituting 
approximately 0.3% (0.2%)* of the shares outstanding) held by the 
Discretionary Account, which, when aggregated, total 823,500 shares of Common 
Stock, constituting approximately 4.9% (3.2%)* of the shares outstanding.
            (iii)  Messrs. Vinik, Gordon and Hostetter each directly owns no 
shares of Common Stock.  By reason of the provisions of Rule 13d-3 of the Act, 
each may be deemed to beneficially own the 584,500 shares beneficially owned
by Vinik Partners, the 776,000 shares beneficially owned by Vinik Overseas,
and the 47,500 shares beneficially owned by the Discretionary Account.  
Such shares total 1,408,000 shares of Common Stock, constituting approximately
8.3% (5.4%)* of the shares outstanding.
            (iv)  VGH owns directly no shares of Common Stock.  By reason 
of the provisions of Rule 13d-3 of the Act, VGH may be deemed to own 
beneficially the 584,500 shares beneficially owned by Vinik Partners, which 
constitutes approximately 3.5% (2.3%)* of the shares outstanding.
            (v)  VAM LLC owns directly no shares of Common Stock.  By reasons
of the provisions of Rule 13d-3 of the Act, VAM LLC may be deemed to own the
776,000 shares beneficially owned by Vinik Overseas and the 47,500 shares 
beneficially owned by the Discretionary Account.  When the shares beneficially 
owned by Vinik Overseas and the Discretionary Account are aggregated they
total 823,500 shares of Common Stock, constituting approximately 4.9% 
(3.2%)*of the shares outstanding.
            (vi)  In the aggregate, the Reporting Persons beneficially
own a total of 1,408,000 shares of Common Stock, constituting approximately
8.3% (5.4%)* of the shares outstanding.

           (b)  Vinik Partners has the power to dispose of and the power to 
vote the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by it, which power may be 
exercised by its general partner, VGH.  Each of Vinik Overseas and the 
Discretionary Account is a party to an investment management agreement with 
VAM LP pursuant to which VAM LP has investment authority with respect to
securities held in such account.  Such authority includes the power to dispose 
of and the power to vote securities held in such accounts.  Such
power may be exercised by VAM LP's general partner, VAM LLC.  Jeffrey N. 
Vinik, as the senior managing member of VGH and VAM LLC, and Messrs. Gordon 
and Hostetter, as managing members thereof, have shared power to dispose 
of and shared power to vote the Common Stock held by other 
Reporting Persons.
            (c)   The trading dates, number of shares of Common Stock
purchased or sold and price per share for all transactions in the Common Stock
from the 60th day prior to January 24, 1997 until February 20, 1997 by Vinik 
Partners and by VAM LP, on behalf of Vinik Overseas and the Discretionary 
Account, are set forth in Schedules A, B and C.  
            (d)   No person other than each respective record owner of shares 
of Common Stock referred to herein is known to have the right to receive or
the power to direct the receipt of dividends from or the proceeds of sale of
such shares of Common Stock.
