Item 4.  Purpose of Transaction.

         Item 4 is amended to read as follows:

         As described more fully in Item 3 above, this Amendment No. 1 relates
to the acquisition of 323,000 shares of Securities by the Reporting Persons. The
Securities acquired by the Reporting Persons have been acquired for the purpose
of making an investment in the Issuer and not with the present intention of
acquiring control of the Issuer's business.

         The Reporting Persons from time to time intend to review their
investment in the Issuer on the basis of various factors, including the Issuer's
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, general
economic and industry conditions, the securities markets in general and those
for the Issuer's securities in particular, as well as other developments and
other investment opportunities. Based upon such review, the Reporting Persons
will take such actions in the future as the Reporting Persons may deem
appropriate in light of the circumstances existing from time to time. If the
Reporting Persons believe that further investment in the Issuer is attractive,
whether because of the market price of the Issuer's securities or otherwise,
they may acquire shares of common stock or other securities of the Issuer either
in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Similarly, depending
on market and other factors, the Reporting Persons may determine to dispose of
some or all of the Securities currently owned by the Reporting Persons or
otherwise acquired by the Reporting Persons either in the open market or in
privately negotiated transactions.


                               Page 23 of 52 Pages

<PAGE>



         Except as set forth above, the Reporting Persons have not formulated
any plans or proposals which relate to or would result in: (a) the acquisition
by any person of additional securities of the Issuer or the disposition of
securities of the Issuer, (b) an extraordinary corporate transaction involving
the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries, (c) a sale or transfer of a material
amount of the assets of the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries, (d) any change in
the present board of directors or management of the Issuer, (e) any material
change in the Issuer's capitalization or dividend policy, (f) any other material
change in the Issuer's business or corporate structure, (g) any change in the
Issuer's charter or bylaws or other or instrument corresponding thereto or other
action which may impede the acquisition of control of the Issuer by any person,
(h) causing a class of the Issuer's securities to be deregistered or delisted,
(i) a class of equity securities of the Issuer becoming eligible for termination
of registration or (j) any action similar to any of those enumerated above.

Item 5.  Interest in Securities of the Issuer.

         Item 5 is amended to read as follows:

         (a)-(b) As a result of the January 6 Transaction, the January 17
Transaction, the April 3 Transaction, the May 2 Transaction and the July 8
Transaction, the Reporting Persons may be deemed to be the beneficial owners of
773,500 shares of Securities. Based upon information contained in the most
recent available filing by the Issuer with the SEC, such Securities constitute
approximately 8.8% of the issued and outstanding Securities. As described above
in Item 2, Isaly and Mehta together own all of the outstanding stock of each of
M and I, CCMI and MIAMI. M and I has full discretionary investment management
authority with respect to the assets of PHARMA/wHEALTH and CCL. CCMI has full
discretionary investment management authority with respect to the assets of
CCLP. MIAMI has full discretionary investment management authority with respect
to the assets of Worldwide. As a result, the Reporting Persons share power to
direct the vote and to direct the disposition of the 773,500 shares of
Securities.

         (c) Except as disclosed in Item 3, neither the Reporting Persons, nor,
to the knowledge of the Reporting Persons, any person named in Schedule I,
Schedule II, Schedule III, Schedule IV, Schedule V, Schedule VI or Schedule VII
has effected any transaction in the Securities during the past 90 days.

         (d) Not applicable.

         (e) Not applicable.

         to Securities of the Issuer.

         Pursuant to the CCL Advisory Agreement, M and I has full discretionary

jointly control the management and operation of, M and I, CCMI and MIAMI.

         Other than the investment management agreements and the relationships
mentioned above, to the best knowledge of the Reporting Persons, there are no
contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships (legal or otherwise)
among the persons named in Item 2 and between such persons and any persons with
respect to any securities of the Issuer, including, but not limited to, transfer
or voting of any of the Securities, finder's fees, joint ventures, loan or
option arrangements, puts or calls, guarantees of profits, division of profits
or loss, or the giving of withholding of proxies.

                                                                 January 1, 1997

Caduceus Capital, Ltd.
Williams House
20 Reid Street
Hamilton HM 11
Bermuda

Dear Sirs:

         We confirm that M and I Investors, Inc. (the "Advisor") will act as the
investment advisor for Caduceus Capital, Ltd., a British Virgin Islands
corporation (the "Fund").

         The Fund has advised us that it proposes to offer and sell its shares
in accordance with the Confidential Information Memorandum of the Fund dated
January 31, 1997, which may be amended or supplemented from time to time (the
"Memorandum"). We acknowledge receipt of the Memorandum and confirm our reliance
on the statements therein. We understand that our activities for the Fund are
subject to (i) the Fund's investment objectives and the investment restrictions
and other statements in the Memorandum, (ii) the provisions of this advisory
agreement ("Agreement"), and (iii) such other directions as to which the Fund
shall from time to time notify the Advisor in writing.

         The Advisor believes that its services can best be performed as
follows:

         1.       The Advisor will have full discretion to allocate the Fund's
                  assets among investment vehicles ("Portfolio Investments") (as
                  described in the Memorandum). The Advisor shall monitor the
                  performance of the Portfolio Investments on a continuing
                  basis. The Advisor shall have discretion to place orders with
                  broker/dealers, foreign currency dealers or others pursuant to
                  the Advisor's determinations and in accordance with Fund's
                  investment objectives and policies as expressed in the
                  Memorandum. The Advisor shall determine which portion of the
                  Fund's assets shall be invested in securities and other assets
                  and which portion, if any, should be held as cash.

         2.       The Advisor shall send or cause to be sent by facsimile
                  transmission or other electronic means to the Fund on the last
                  business day of each month (and such additional dates as the
                  Fund and we may from time to time agree upon in advance) a
                  portfolio statement reflecting the allocation of assets of the
                  Fund as

                                                                      Exhibit A.



                  of the close of business (5:00 p.m. Bermuda time) on the
                  immediately preceding business day. For such purpose, the
                  portfolio shall be deemed to include, without limitation,
                  investment securities, receivables in respect of securities
                  sold and cash items, including proceeds of sales of
                  securities. On the second business day following each trade
                  date, we shall send or cause to be sent by facsimile
                  transmission or other electronic means confirmations of all
                  trades executed on the Fund's behalf on such trade date and
                  provide such other information on the trades as the Fund and
                  we may agree upon.

         3.       Upon reasonable request the Advisor shall provide the Fund or
                  its board of directors with such information as the Fund or
                  its board of directors deems necessary for purposes of
                  monitoring the performance of the Advisor's obligations and
                  duties set forth herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
                  neither the Fund nor its board of directors shall have direct
                  access to the Advisor's books and records, which shall be
                  deemed the confidential and proprietary property of the
                  Advisor.

         4.       The Advisor shall not be liable for its acts, or omissions to
                  act, in connection with its obligations hereunder, provided
                  that it has not acted with bad faith, gross negligence or
                  reckless disregard of its obligations and duties set forth
                  herein. The Advisory Board (as described in the Memorandum)
                  shall not be liable for any acts, or omissions to act, in
                  connection with the rendering of advisory services to the
                  Advisor or in connection with the Advisor's rendering of
                  services to the Fund.

         5.       (a) The Advisor represents and confirms to the Fund that (i)
                  all statements concerning the Advisor, its affiliates, the
                  investments it will make on behalf of the Fund and the
                  characteristics, potential benefits and risks of such
                  investments, as described in the Memorandum, are in all
                  material respects true and accurate and do not omit any
                  material fact which would, in light of the circumstances under
                  which such statements are made or otherwise, be required in
                  order to make such statements not misleading; (ii) the Advisor
                  will advise the Fund promptly of any change which, from time
                  to time, may be necessary to ensure that such statements
                  remain in all material respects true and accurate and do not
                  omit any material fact which, in light of the circumstances
                  under which such statements are made or otherwise, is required
                  in order to make such statements not misleading; and (iii) the
                  Advisor (A) has all the requisite authority to enter into,
                  execute and deliver and perform its obligations hereunder, and
                  (B) will not breach any agreement or law to which it is
                  subject by performing its obligations hereunder. The Advisor
                  hereby agrees to indemnify and hold the Fund harmless from,
                  against and in respect of any and all damage, liability, cost
                  and expense, including reasonable legal fees and

                               Page 47 of 52 Pages

                                                                      Exhibit A.



                  expenses, suffered or incurred by the Fund by reason of any
                  breach of any representation contained in this paragraph.

                  (b) The Fund represents and confirms to the Advisor that (i)
                  the shares of the Fund (the "Shares") have not been and will
                  not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as
                  amended; (ii) the Fund will not be registered under the U.S.
                  Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended; and (iii) except
                  as provided in the Memorandum, the Shares have not been and
                  are not being offered for sale (A) in the United States (or
                  any of its territories, possessions or areas subject to its
                  jurisdiction), (B) to any person who is a "U.S. Person" (as
                  defined in the Memorandum) or (C) to any person purchasing for
                  the account of or for resale to any U.S. Person. By its
                  signature at the foot of this Agreement, the Fund agrees to
                  indemnify and hold the Advisor harmless from, against and in
                  respect of any and all damage, liability, cost and expense,
                  including reasonable legal fees and expenses, suffered or
                  incurred by the Advisor by reason of any breach of any
                  representation contained in this paragraph.

         6.       This Agreement has an indefinite term but may be terminated
                  without penalty by the Advisor or by the Fund on thirty (30)
                  days' prior written notice, and terminates automatically upon
                  assignment by the Advisor without the Fund's consent.

         7.       The Advisor shall receive a management fee from the Fund for
                  its services at the rate of 1.00% per annum, payable
                  quarterly, based on the Net Asset Value of the Shares, as
                  defined in the Memorandum, preceding the beginning of quarter.

         8.       (a) You have represented to us that (i) under the laws of the
                  British Virgin Islands, the Fund is permitted to pay an
                  incentive fee to the Advisor; and (ii) the payment of
                  incentive fees to investment advisors by enterprises such as
                  the Fund is legal under the applicable laws of the British
                  Virgin Islands. Based on the foregoing, the Advisor agrees to
                  accept an incentive fee (as calculated below) as payment for
                  its services.

                  (b) The Advisor shall receive an incentive fee from the Fund
                  for its services paid annually at the rate of 20% of the full
                  increase in the value of the Shares, appropriately adjusted
                  for any subscriptions, distributions or redemptions in that
                  year. The annual period upon which the incentive fee shall be
                  based ends on the Valuation Date on or immediately preceding
                  the end of the Fund's Fiscal Year and commences on the last
                  Valuation Date of the preceding Fiscal Year (which in the case
                  of the first year of the Fund is the date on which the Fund
                  commences operations). Upon redemption of Shares

                                                                      Exhibit A.



                  at any time other than the end of the Fiscal Year, the Fund
                  will deduct from the proceeds of redemption, and pay to the
                  Advisor, an amount equal to 20% of the full aggregate increase
                  in the net asset value of the Shares being redeemed since the
                  end of the preceding Fiscal Year.

         9.       The Advisor shall be authorized to determine the broker/dealer
                  to be used for each securities transaction for the Fund. In
                  selecting broker/dealers to execute transactions, the Advisor
                  need not solicit competitive bids and does not have an
                  obligation to seek the lowest available cost. In selecting
                  broker/dealers, the Advisor may or may not negotiate
                  "execution only" commission rates; thus, the Fund may be
                  deemed to be paying for other services provided by such
                  broker/dealer, even though the Fund may not, in any particular
                  instance, be the direct or indirect beneficiary of the
                  research or services provided.

         10.      It is understood that the Advisor is an independent contractor
                  and not an employee or agent of the Fund.

         11.      The Advisor's services hereunder are not to be deemed
                  exclusive and it is understood that we may render investment
                  advice, management and services to others. It is specifically
                  understood and agreed that our advice to others may, from time
                  to time, be inconsistent with that given to the Fund. The
                  Advisor may purchase and sell assets for the accounts of other
                  of its clients with investment objectives similar to those of
                  the Fund. In case of a conflict between the Fund's account and
                  one or more of such other accounts, where there is a limited
                  supply of a particular investment or a limited opportunity to
                  sell any investment, the Advisor will act in the manner it
                  considers equitable and consistent with its obligations both
                  to the Fund and to its other clients. It is specifically
                  understood and agreed that the Advisor cannot assure equal
                  treatment among all of its clients at all times.
