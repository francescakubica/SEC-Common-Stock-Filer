PRELIMINARY NOTE

     This Joint Amendment No. 2 (as defined below) is being filed because the
filing persons may be deemed to be members of a group comprised of Tweedy,
Browne Company L.P. ("TBC") and Vanderbilt Partners, L.P. ("Vanderbilt"), which
group may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of in excess of 5% of the Common
Stock of Proler International Corporation and is prompted by an examination on
October 25, 1995 of the Issuer's report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June
30, 1995.    However the filing of this Joint Amendment No. 2 (as defined
below) should not be deemed an admission that TBC and Vanderbilt comprise a
group within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities and Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the "Act").

     Puruant to Rule 13d-2(a) of Regulation 13D-G of the General Rules and
Regulations, each of TBC and Vanderbilt hereby amend their respective
Statements on Schedule 13D, relating to the Common Stock of Proler
International Corporation.  TBC filed a Statement on Schedule 13D, dated as of
December 14, 1994, (the"TBC 13D").  Subsequently, Vanderbilt filed a Statement
on Schedule 13D, dated as of January 26, 1995, (the "Vanderbilt 13D"), which
was also Amendment No. 1 filed by TBC to the TBC 13D (the "Combined
Statement/Amendment").  The Combined Statement/Amendment was also subsequently
amended by TBC and Vanderbilt and was dated as of March 10, 1995 (the "Joint
Amendment No. 1").  This joint filing by TBC and Vanderbilt is Amendment No. 3
to the TBC 13D and Amendment No. 2 to the Vanderbilt 13D and is dated as of
February 6, 1996 (the "Joint Amendment No. 2").  Pursuant to Item 101(a)(2)(ii)
of Regulation S-T, this Joint Amendment No. 2 also includes an amended and
restated composite of all paper filings to date made by TBC and Vanderbilt,
respectively, on Schedule 13D with respect to Proler International Corporation.

ITEM 1.  SECURITY AND ISSUER

     This Schedule 13D  relates to the Common Stock, $1.00 par value (the
"Common Stock"), of Proler International Corporation (the "Company"), which, to
the best knowledge of the persons filing this Amendment, is a company organized
under the laws of Delaware, with its principal executive offices located at
4265 San Felipe Avenue, Suite 900, Houston, Texas 77027.

ITEM 2.  IDENTITY AND BACKGROUND

     (a)  The persons filing this Schedule 13D are (i) Tweedy, Browne Company
L.P. ("TBC"), a Delaware limited partnership and (ii)  Vanderbilt Partners,
L.P. ("Vanderbilt"), a Delaware limited partnership.  Annexed as Exhibit 99.1,
which is incorporated by reference herein, is an agreement between TBC and
Vanderbilt that this Schedule 13D is filed on behalf of each of them.  The
filing of this Schedule 13D  should not be deemed an admission that TBC  and
Vanderbilt comprise a group within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Act").

     This Schedule 13D contains information regarding shares of Common Stock
that may be deemed to be beneficially owned by TBC.  Such shares are held in
the accounts of various customers of TBC, with respect to which accounts TBC
has investment discretion (the  "TBC Accounts"), and with respect to some of
which it has obtained sole or shared voting power.

     The general partners of TBC and Vanderbilt are Christopher H. Browne,
William H. Browne and John D. Spears (the "General Partners").   By reason of
their positions as general partners in TBC and Vanderbilt, the General Partners
may be deemed to control TBC and Vanderbilt, respectively.

<PAGE>   6

     (b)  The business address of each of TBC, Vanderbilt and the General
Partners is 52 Vanderbilt Avenue, New York, New York 10017.

     (c)  TBC is engaged primarily in the business of a securities broker and
dealer and investment adviser, is registered as a broker-dealer and investment
adviser with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is a member of the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.

      Vanderbilt is a private investment partnership and is currently, and at
all relevant times was, engaged primarily in the business of investing in
securities for its own account.

       The present principal occupation of each of the General Partners is
serving as such for TBC, Vanderbilt and TBK Partners, L.P., a private
investment partnership.  The principal business address of TBC and Vanderbilt
is set forth above.  The principal business address of TBK Partners, L.P. is 52
Vanderbilt Avenue, New York, New York 10017.

     (d)  None of TBC, Vanderbilt, nor any General Partner has, during the last
five years, been convicted in any criminal proceeding (excluding traffic
violations and similar misdemeanors).

     (e)  None of TBC, Vanderbilt, nor any General Partner  has, during the
last five years, been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or
administrative body of competent jurisdiction as a result of which proceeding
it or he was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining
future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to,
federal or state securities laws or finding any violations with respect
thereto.

     (f)  Each of TBC and Vanderbilt is a Delaware limited partnership.  Each
of the General Partners is a citizen of the United States of Ameria.

ITEM 3.   SOURCE AND AMOUNT OF FUNDS OR OTHER CONSIDERATION

     As of the date hereof, the number of shares with respect to which TBC may
be deemed to be the beneficial owner is 453, 923 shares of Common Stock (the
"TBC Shares"), all of which shares were purchased in open market transactions.
The aggregate cost of the TBC Shares, including brokerage commissions, was 
$3,166,365.

     The TBC Shares are held in the TBC Accounts, the funds therefor coming
from the funds on hand in each individual managed account and in certain
instances from standard margin account borrowings from brokerage accounts
maintained at Fleet Clearing Corporation.  It is expected that funds used by
the TBC Accounts to purchase additional shares of Common Stock, if additional
shares are purchased by the TBC Accounts (see Item 4 hereof), will come from
the funds on hand for each individual managed account, which funds on hand at
any time and from time to time may include, among others, funds borrowed
pursuant to margin accounts maintained at Fleet Clearing Corporation.
Borrowings made by certain TBC Accounts pursuant to such margin accounts are
secured by margin securities owned by the respective accounts, including some
of the TBC Shares.  Interest on outstanding borrowings under such margin
accounts ranges from 1/2% to 2% over the brokers' call rate in effect from time
to time at Chemical Bank, New York, New York, depending upon the amount of
outstanding borrowings at any given time.

     As of the date hereof, Vanderbilt beneficially owns directly 5,000 shares
of Common Stock (the "Vanderbilt Shares"), all of which shares were purchased
in open market transactions.  The aggregate market value of the Vanderbilt
Shares, including brokerage commissions, was $32,867.

<PAGE>   7

     It is expected that funds used by Vanderbilt to purchase additional shares
of Common Stock, if additional shares are purchased by Vanderbilt (see Item 4
hereof), will come from Vanderbilt's general funds, which include cash and cash
equivalents on hand and in banks.

     Vanderbilt's general funds have included, and it is expected that they
will from time to time include, funds borrowed by it pursuant to an
understanding with Chemical Bank.  No borrowings from Chemical Bank were made
by Vanderbilt for the purpose of acquiring the Vanderbilt Shares.  Vanderbilt
reserves the right to include all or any of the shares of Common Stock owned by
it at any time or from time to time, among the securities that serve as
collateral for such borrowings, subject to compliance with any applicable
statutes and regulations.

ITEM 4.  PURPOSE OF TRANSACTION

     Each of TBC and Vanderbilt has acquired the shares of Common Stock owned
by it for investment purposes and for none of the reasons enumerated in Item 4
of Schedule 13D, except that TBC  and Vanderbilt may dispose of all or some of
the TBC Shares and the Vanderbilt Shares, respectively, or may acquire
additional shares of Common Stock from time to time, depending upon price and
market conditions, evaluation of alternative investments, and other factors.
Currently, TBC  and Vanderbilt intend to acquire additional shares of Common
Stock in the open market, depending upon the price of the Common Stock from
time to time.

ITEM 5.  INTEREST IN SECURITIES OF THE ISSUER

     (a)  As of the date hereof, TBC may be deemed to be the beneficial owner
