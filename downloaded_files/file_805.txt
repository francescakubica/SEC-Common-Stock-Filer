         The reason for the filing of this Amendment No. 1 to the
         previously filed Schedule 13D is to show that the
         holdings of Kingdon Capital Management Corporation
         ("KCMC") in the shares of Common Stock (the "Common
         Stock") in Stillwater Mining Company ("PGMS") have
         decreased from 8.6% to 4.30%.

Item 1.  Security and Issuer

         This statement relates to the Common Stock of PGMS.
         PGMS's principal executive office is located at HC 54,
         Box 365, Nye, Montana 59061.

Item 2.  Identity and Background

         This statement is being filed on behalf of KCMC, a
         Delaware corporation.  KCMC's principal business is to
         act as an investment adviser; its principal office is at
         152 West 57th Street, New York, New York 10019.

         Mr. Mark Kingdon is the sole shareholder, director and
         executive officer of KCMC.  Mr. Kingdon has not, during
         the last five years, been convicted in a criminal
         proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar
         misdemeanors).  Mr. Kingdon has not, during the last
         five years, been a party to a civil proceeding of a
         judicial or administrative body of competent
         jurisdiction which resulted in a judgment, decree or
         final order enjoining future violations of, or
         prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal
         or state securities laws or finding any violations with
         respect to such laws.

         Mr. Kingdon is a citizen of the United States of
         America.

Item 3.  Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.

         As of the date hereof, KCMC is deemed to beneficially
         own 865,870 shares of Common Stock.  All 865,870 shares
         of PGMS' Common Stock are held by entities or managed
         accounts over which KCMC has investment discretion.  All
         transactions in the shares of Common Stock of PGMS
         reported on Exhibit A hereto were open market
         transactions. The funds for the purchase of the shares
         of Common Stock of PGMS held in the entities or managed
         accounts over which KCMC has investment discretion have
         come from each entity or account's own funds.  No
         leverage was used to purchase the shares of Common
         Stock.



                                4



<PAGE>

Item 4.  Purpose of Transactions.

         The shares of Common Stock of PGMS deemed to be
         beneficially owned by KCMC were acquired for, and are
         being held for, investment purposes.

         KCMC has no plan or proposal which relates to, or would
         result in, any of the actions enumerated in Item 4 of
         the instructions to Schedule 13D.

Item 5.  Interest in Securities of Issuer.

         As of the date hereof, KCMC is deemed to be the
         beneficial owner of 865,870 shares of Common Stock in
         PGMS.  Based on the most recent information from PGMS,
         we believe there to be 20,126,902 shares of Common Stock
         in PGMS outstanding.  Therefore, KCMC is deemed to
         beneficially own 4.30% of the outstanding shares of
         Common Stock in PGMS.  KCMC has the sole power to vote,
         direct the vote, dispose of or direct the disposition of
         all the shares of Common Stock in PGMS that it is
         currently deemed to beneficially own.  KCMC ceased to be
         the beneficial owner of more than 5% of the outstanding
         Common Stock of PGMS on November 19, 1996.

Item 6.  Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or
         Relationships with Respect to Securities of the Issuer

         KCMC has no contract, arrangement, understanding or
         relationship with any person with respect to the Common
         Stock in PGMS.

Item 7.  Material to be Filed as Exhibits.

         Attached hereto as Exhibit A is a description of the
         transactions in the Common Stock in PGMS that have been
         effected by KCMC since 60 days prior to November 1,
         1996.
