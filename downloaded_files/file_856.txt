ITEM 3.  SOURCE AND AMOUNT OF FUNDS OR OTHER CONSIDERATION

         As of the date hereof, the number of Units with respect to which TBC
may be deemed to be the beneficial owner is 894,750 Units (the "TBC Units"),
all of which Units were purchased in open market transactions.  The aggregate
cost of the TBC Units, including brokerage commissions, was $7,298,276.

         The TBC Units are held in the TBC Accounts, the funds therefor coming
from the funds on hand in each individual managed account and in certain
instances from standard margin account borrowings from brokerage accounts
maintained at Fleet Clearing Corporation.  It is expected that funds used by
the TBC Accounts to purchase additional Units, if additional Units are
purchased by the TBC Accounts (see Item 4 hereof), will come from the funds on
hand for each individual managed account, which funds on hand at any time and
from time to time may include, among others, funds borrowed pursuant to margin
accounts maintained at Fleet Clearing Corporation.  Borrowings made by certain
TBC Accounts pursuant to such margin accounts are secured by margin securities
owned by the respective accounts, including some of the TBC Units.  Interest on
outstanding borrowings under such margin accounts ranges from 1/2% to 2% over
the brokers' call rate in effect from time to time at Chemical Bank, New York,
New York, depending upon the amount of outstanding borrowings at any given
time.

         As of the date hereof, TBK beneficially owns directly 103,700 Units
(the "TBK Units"), all of which Units were purchased in open market
transactions.  (TBK and certain of the general partners in TBK, who are also
general partners of TBC and Vanderbilt may also be deemed to be the indirect
beneficial owners of certain other Units, as set forth in Item 5 hereof.)  The
aggregate cost  of the TBK Units, including brokerage commissions, was
$910,856.





                                        
<PAGE>   7


         It is expected that funds used by TBK to purchase additional units, if
additional units are purchased by TBK (see Item 4 hereof), will come from TBK's
general funds, which include cash and cash equivalents on hand and in banks.

         TBK's general funds have included, and it is expected that they will
from time to time include, funds borrowed by it pursuant to an understanding
with Chemical Bank.  As of the date hereof, TBK has a loan outstanding with
Chemical Bank in the amount of $20,000.00.  Borrowings made by TBK pursuant to
that understanding bear interest at the brokers' call rate in effect from time
to time at Chemical Bank. TBK's funds on hand have also included, and it is
expected that they will from time to time include, funds borrowed by it
pursuant to an understanding with The Bank of New York, New York, New York.
Pursuant to that understanding, TBK may borrow funds at the brokers' call rate
charged from time to time by The Bank of New York.  As of the date hereof, TBK
has a loan outstanding with The Bank of New York in the amount of $10,000.00.
Borrowings made by TBK pursuant to its understandings with Chemical Bank and
The Bank of New York are secured by securities owned by TBK; such borrowings
are not secured by any TBK Units.  No borrowings from Chemical Bank or The Bank
of New York were made for the purpose of acquiring the TBK Units.  TBK reserves
the right to include all or any of the Units owned by it at any time or from
time to time, among the securities that serve as collateral for such
borrowings, subject to compliance with any applicable statutes and regulations.

         As of the date hereof, Vanderbilt beneficially owns directly 10,000
Units (the "Vanderbilt Units"), all of which Units were purchased in open
market transactions.  (Vanderbilt and certain of the general partners in
Vanderbilt, who are also general partners in TBC and TBK may also be deemed to
be the indirect beneficial owners of certain other Units, as set forth in Item
5 hereof.)  The aggregate cost of the Vanderbilt Units, including brokerage
commissions, was $77,303.

         It is expected that funds used by Vanderbilt to purchase additional
Units, if additional Units are purchased by Vanderbilt (see Item 4 hereof),
will come from Vanderbilt's general funds, which include cash and cash
equivalents on hand and in banks.

         Vanderbilt's general funds have included, and it is expected that they
will from time to time include, funds borrowed by it pursuant to an
understanding with Chemical Bank.  No borrowings from Chemical Bank were made
by Vanderbilt for the purpose of acquiring the Vanderbilt Units.  Vanderbilt
reserves the right to include all or any of the Units owned by it at any time
or from time to time, among the securities that serve as collateral for such
borrowings, subject to compliance with any applicable statutes and regulations.

ITEM 4.  PURPOSE OF TRANSACTION

         Each of TBC, TBK and Vanderbilt has acquired the Units owned by it for
investment purposes and for none of the reasons enumerated in Item 4 of
Schedule 13D, except that TBC, TBK and Vanderbilt may dispose of all or some of
the TBC Units, the TBK Units and the Vanderbilt Units, respectively, or may
acquire additional Units from time to time, depending upon price and market
conditions, evaluation of alternative investments, and other factors.
Currently, TBC, TBK and Vanderbilt intend to acquire additional Units in the
open market, depending upon the price of the Units from time to time.

         (a)  As of the date hereof, TBC may be deemed to be the beneficial
owner of an aggregate of 894,750 Units, which constitutes approximately 6.48%
of the 13,812,800 Units which TBC believes to be the total number of Units

Units outstanding.  The aggregate number of Units and percentage of Units  with
respect to which Thomas P. Knapp may be deemed to be a beneficial owner by
reason of his being a general partner of TBK is 103,700 Units which constitutes
approximately 0.75% of the 13,812,800 Units outstanding.  However, nothing
contained herein shall be construed as an admission that any of the General
Partners or Thomas P. Knapp is the beneficial owner of any Units, except as set
forth herein as expressly and admittedly being beneficially owned by a
particular General Partner or Thomas P. Knapp.

         Each of TBC, TBK and Vanderbilt disclaims beneficial ownership of
Units held by the other.  Except as described herein, to the best knowledge of
TBC, TBK and Vanderbilt, no person who may be deemed to comprise a group with
any of TBC, TBK, Vanderbilt, or any other person named in Item 2 hereof,
beneficially owns any Units.

         (b)     TBC has investment discretion with respect to 894,750 Units
held by the TBC Accounts and has sole power to dispose or direct the
