          ITEM 1.   SECURITY AND ISSUER.

          This statement on Schedule 13D (the "Statement")

relates to the common stock, no par value (the "Common Stock"),

of International Colin Energy Corporation, a Canadian corporation

(the "Issuer"), whose principal executive offices are located at

1210, 333 - 11th Avenue S.W., Calgary, Alberta, Canada, T2R1L9.

          ITEM 2.   IDENTITY AND BACKGROUND.

          This Statement is being filed by Halcyon/Alan B. Slifka

Management Company LLC ("Halcyon"), Alan B. Slifka and Company,

Limited ("ABS & Co.") and Alan B. Slifka ("Slifka"), an

individual resident of the State of New York.  Halcyon, ABS & Co.

and Slifka are referred to herein as the "Reporting Persons."

          Halcyon is a limited liability company organized under

the laws of the State of Delaware.  The principal business

address of Halcyon is 477 Madison Avenue, 8th Floor, New York,

New York 10022.  The members of Halcyon are Alan B. Slifka and

Company, Limited, Alan B. Slifka, Herbert S. Adler, John M.

Bader, Randolph W. Slifka, and James W. Sykes (collectively, the

"Members").  ABS & Co. is a corporation organized under the laws

of the State of New York and has its principal business address

at 477 Madison Avenue, 8th Floor, New York, New York 10022.

Slifka is an individual resident of the State of New York with a

mailing address of Alan B. Slifka, c/o Alan B. Slifka and

Company, Limited, 477 Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10022.

          The executive officers and directors of ABS & Co. are

Alan B. Slifka (President and sole director), James Sykes (Vice

President) and James Pasquarelli (Treasurer and Secretary) (the

"Instruction C Persons").

          During the last five years, neither the Reporting

Persons, any Member, nor any Instruction C Person (i) has been

convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations

or similar misdemeanors) or (ii) has been a party to a civil

                       Page 5 of 15 Pages

<PAGE>

violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to,

federal or state securities laws, or finding any violation with

respect to such laws.

          ITEM 3.   SOURCE AND AMOUNT OF FUNDS OR OTHER
                    CONSIDERATION.

          The total consideration for the acquisition of the

shares of Common Stock is $3,421,270.04.  The funds to acquire

the shares of Common Stock acquired by Halcyon on behalf of its

clients, including certain of the limited partnerships in which

Halcyon is the general partner, came from the working capital of

such clients.

          ITEM 4.   PURPOSE OF THE TRANSACTION.

          On behalf of certain clients to whom Halcyon provides

investment advice and management services, including clients who

are limited partnerships in which Halcyon is the general partner,

Halcyon has acquired the Common Stock covered by this Statement

for investment purposes.  Halcyon intends to evaluate the

performance of such Common Stock as an investment in the ordinary

course of its business.  Halcyon may seek to acquire additional

Common Stock or to dispose of some or all of the Common Stock

which it beneficially owns.  Such actions will depend upon a

variety of factors, including, without limitation, current and

anticipated future trading prices for such securities, any

further actions taken by unrelated third parties who have

indicated they are seeking control of the Issuer, the financial

condition, results of operations and prospects of the Issuer,

alternate investment opportunities, and general economic,

financial market and industry conditions.

          ITEM 5.   INTEREST IN SECURITIES OF THE ISSUER.

          (a)  As of June 5,1996, certain clients of Halcyon,

including certain limited partnerships in which Halcyon is the

general partner, beneficially owned 646,500 shares of Common

Stock representing 5.02% of the outstanding shares of Common

Stock.  This percentage is based upon 12,868,021 shares of the

Common Stock outstanding as of November 19, 1995, as reported in

the Issuer's most recently filed Form 10-Q.  Because Halcyon has

full investment discretion over, including the power to

                       Page 6 of 15 Pages

<PAGE>

dispose of, the Common Stock, as of June 5, 1996, Halcyon may be

deemed to have beneficially owned 646,500 shares of Common Stock.

Further, as managing member of Halcyon, ABS & Co. also may be

deemed to have beneficially owned 646,500 shares of Common Stock

as of  June 5, 1996.  As the sole shareholder of ABS & Co.,

Slifka also may be deemed to have beneficially owned 646,500

shares of Common Stock as of June 5, 1996.

          (b)  ABS & Co., as managing member of Halcyon, has sole

power to dispose or direct the disposition of the Common Stock

beneficially owned by Halcyon.

          (c)  During the past sixty days, on behalf of certain

of its clients, including certain limited partnerships in which

Halcyon is the general partner, Halcyon has purchased the

following shares of Common Stock, at the following prices, in the

following markets:
