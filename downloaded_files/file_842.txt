and dispose of the shares of the Issuer's Common Stock that the other TCW
Related Entities have power to vote and dispose, all of which constitutes
5,223,953 shares of the Issuer's Common Stock.

Oaktree, as the fund manager of the Principal Fund pursuant to the
subadvisory agreement between TAMCO and Oaktree, may be deemed to have the
power to vote and dispose of certain of the shares of the Issuer's Common
Stock that the Principal Fund has power to vote and dispose.  In addition,
Oaktree, as the investment manager of the Oaktree Accounts, has the
discretionary authority and control over all of the assets of the Oaktree
Accounts  pursuant to the investment management agreements relating to such
accounts, including the power to vote and to dispose of 203,271 shares of the
Issuer's Common Stock held in the name of the Oaktree Accounts.  Therefore,
Oaktree has the power to vote and dispose of 3,683,613 shares of the Issuer's
Common Stock.

  (c) Except for the transactions by the Principal Fund, Special Credits and
TAMCO described herein, neither Oaktree nor any of the TCW Related Entities,
and to the best of their knowledge, none of their respective executive
officers, directors or general partners has effected transactions involving
the Issuer's Common Stock during the period since the filing of Amendment No.
8 to Schedule 13D filed on behalf of the TCW Related Entities and Oaktree.

  (d) None

ITEM 6.     CONTRACTS, ARRANGEMENTS, UNDERSTANDINGS OR RELATIONSHIPS WITH
            RESPECT TO SECURITIES OF THE ISSUER

Special Credits, as general partner of Fund IIIb, receives a fee for managing
all the assets of Fund IIIb.  In addition, Special Credits, as investment
manager of the Special Credits Accounts, receives a management fee for
managing the assets of each Special Credits Account.  Fund IIIb and the
Special Credits Accounts have similar investment strategies of investing in
financially distressed entities; however, the implementation of these
strategies may differ from partnership to partnership and account to account.
Certain of the Oaktree Accounts have similar investment strategies of
investing in financially distressed entities, while one of the Oaktree
Accounts has an investment strategy of investing in high-yield debt
instruments but also contributed shares of the Issuer's Common Stock to the
account at the inception of its management by Oaktree.

TAMCO, as general partner of the Principal Fund, receives a management fee
for its management of the Principal Fund.  Pursuant to a subadvisory
agreement between TAMCO and Oaktree, the Principal Fund is managed by
Oaktree, who receives a portion of the management fee received by TAMCO.  The
Principal Fund's investment strategy is to invest in entities in which there
is a potential for the Principal Fund to exercise significant influence over
management.  In addition, Oaktree, as investment manager of the Oaktree
Accounts, receives management fees or incentive fees for managing the assets
of each Oaktree Account.

TCW, as trustee of Special Credits Trusts, receives a management fee for
managing all the assets of Special Credits Trusts.  The Special Credits
Trusts each have an investment strategy similar to Fund IIIb and Special
Credits Accounts in investing in financially distressed entities.  However,
the implementation of this strategy may differ from entity to entity and
account to account.

Except to the extent the securities referred to in this Statement constitute
assets of the Special Credits Entities and Special Credits Accounts, and the
Principal Fund, there are no contracts, understandings or relationships
(legal or otherwise) among or between any member of the TCW Related Entities
or, to the best of their knowledge, their respective executive officers,
directors or general partners or between or among any of such persons and
with respect to any securities of the Issuer.
